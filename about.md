My name is Ryan Rodenbaugh. I am a co-founder of [Wallfacer Labs](https://wallfacer.io/), where we are building better ways to earn onchain. 

- Wallfacer has a great research blog you should [read](https://wallfacerlabs.substack.com/). 
- I also host the Wallfacer podcast, which I'd love for you to [listen to](https://www.wallfacer.io/podcast). 

At Wallfacer, our sole product focus is building vaults.fyi into the definitive place people go to earn onchain. You can access our full [application](https://app.vaults.fyi/), [data dashboard](https://www.vaults.fyi/), and [developer APIs](https://docs.vaults.fyi/api/vaults.fyi-api/insights-api).
