My name is Ryan Rodenbaugh. I am a co-founder of [Wallfacer Labs](https://wallfacer.io/), a crypto research and development company. Wallfacer has a great research blog you should [read](https://wallfacerlabs.substack.com/). I also host the Wallfacer podcast, which I'd love for you to [listen to](https://www.wallfacer.io/podcast). 

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ryanrodenbaugh/), and [Farcaster](https://warpcast.com/ryanrodenbaugh). 

Also, I guess [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanrodenbaugh/) if you like that.
