In a prior role, I was asked to write out what I thought were interesting areas of investment for a venture capital firm. For me, almost all of these ideas came down to the (broadly defined) ‘future of work’. A lot of change will come as a result of the nature of work shifting. I wrote out my beliefs at length [here](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1FOgbY0_9S7i5P7JbiRT-NoNEk3Bn4JWmK-8Ld_1r-Pg%2Fedit%23&t=OTFmYWExY2I3NzViMmRhZGI5NDExZmQ1YjM3Nzk1YjAwOGQ0ZGRlYSw5aTl1UEwwTA%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F612597685541814272%2Fthe-future-of-work&m=1&ref=ryanrodenbaugh.com). The majority of that post was written in December 2017, with the last section (noted in the doc) being written in December 2018.

Some of my additional areas of interest/investment can be found in [this doc](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1vKmgd3m46SCVa_FflDzdPo5zG5F3S9qyVZddmPlrTs4%2Fedit&t=YjQxMWM2NWJkNWEzMGRmYzRjOWU0MTQ3YzhiY2JkZTc1MjUyZWI2MCw5aTl1UEwwTA%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F612597685541814272%2Fthe-future-of-work&m=1&ref=ryanrodenbaugh.com). These ideas are less crystallized and as a result, the format is more brain dump.
