- Vaping
- Hearing loss from headphones
- Pre-workout drinks (remember the original Jack3d?)
- Sleep deprivation
- Loss of ability to focus for extended periods (thanks, Facebook)
- Lack of children's play affecting development and socialization

### Key Insights

**On American Social Life**:
> In the 21st century, the main question in American social life is not 'how do we make that happen?' but 'how do we get management to take our side?' This is a learned response, and a culture which has internalized it will not be a culture that 'builds.'

**On Chinese Governance**:
> Even now both the Party and the state bureaucracies that canvas the Chinese hinterland are highly decentralized; these government and Party units are given a great deal of room for experimentation and in many realms are practically independent from outside control.
