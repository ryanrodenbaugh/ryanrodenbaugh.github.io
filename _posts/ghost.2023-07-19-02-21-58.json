I’ve been fortunate enough to never be in a serious\naccident, but I also consider myself to be a very cautious driver, usually\nopting on the side of caution, letting others go first, not speeding through\nyellow lights, etc. Having been a passenger in many other people’s cares,\nhowever, I know that not everyone drives this way, yet by and large driving\nworks all around the world (yes 10K deaths and 1M+ injuried from autho every\nyear, but generally it works). What are other systems that require the\nindepedent action of millions of people that just work? (not necessarily market\nor finance related)\n\n *","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542887800-faca0261c9e1?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-07T21:28:33.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-20T04:00:53.000Z","published_at":"2017-08-07T21:29:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f04ea544e0ddd003912e504","uuid":"63abd1b1-f944-4cd6-940e-7c0a96e6ee9d","title":"Do Bubbles Have to Burst?","slug":"bubbles","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/de94782df62cc5051cce669e35fb7951/tumblr_inline_ovvic0dr231v3mmrv_500.png\",\"alt\":\"image\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8452d127e56eb37a10a7962d2ce0405/tumblr_inline_ovviy9R78S1v3mmrv_500.png\",\"alt\":\"image\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec1d6046bd64bf6b7f5cf72c093c6ffe/tumblr_inline_ovvix1y6Uy1v3mmrv_500.png\",\"alt\":\"image\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/69284bd2300785b5f683235072ed2518/tumblr_inline_ovvjjckqlZ1v3mmrv_500.png\",\"alt\":\"image\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/42565fa77c359e6217d5fdfa873d19f4/tumblr_inline_ovvjda3tst1v3mmrv_500.png\",\"alt\":\"image\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cb52f104434563bb716b8a51c59e955f/tumblr_inline_ovvm7g4RfO1v3mmrv_500.png\",\"alt\":\"image\",\"title\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Flight_path_of_Oceanic_815\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/cburniske?lang=en\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/905268996022435840\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/prestonjbyrne?lang=en\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.investopedia.com%2Fterms%2Fb%2Fbubble.asp&t=YmY5OTVmNWI1MDg5YjIyM2M3OTkyNWU3MzFmMGJmY2FkZDY4MjYxNSxyaDNYejc4Nw%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F165057941497%2Fdo-bubbles-have-to-burst&m=1\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/ianjohnlee/status/893877186205057024\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fhowmuch.net%2Farticles%2Fworlds-money-in-perspective&t=NTJkZWI4NmY5Yzc0MzMzYzAxOTczMDUyMzUyOTgwNGE1MTRkYjI2ZixyaDNYejc4Nw%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F165057941497%2Fdo-bubbles-have-to-burst&m=1\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I compare the feeling of waiting for an economic bubble to burst to being on a long plane ride without any idea what time it is.

If any readers have research they could share regarding urban v. suburban v. rural car ownership trends, that would be appreciated.

I will not attempt the math here (maybe a project for another time), but if there are currently 45,000 Uber and Lyft drivers in SF, let’s assume (naively) 50/50 for each company and that at bare minimum an AV would be $20K (again a naïve estimate), that means each company would have to shell out $450 M just to get an AV market built out in SF.

So, there’s a lot of difficulties surrounding bringing TNCs to market as the leading form of autonomous transportation. For non-autonomous cars to lead the way in the transportation-as-a-service (”TAAS”) market, a lot of people still need to own cars to be able to provide service to those that don’t. In the autonomous realm, TNCs need to be willing to make HUGE capital investments to bring large autonomous fleets to consumers. Then there’s a third scenario (not yet explored) in which a % of consumers own AVs and have them \"],[0,[10],1,\"drive people around\"],[0,[],0,\" (TAAS-style) during the 95% of the day when they’d otherwise be sitting idly. Elon Musk has spoken the most about this and it sounds like a huge incentive to own a Tesla. If your Tesla earned you $50/day chauffeuring others around for the 23 hours you aren’t using it, you could pay the car off in 2 years flat (assuming you drove a no-frills Tesla Model 3). Obviously, there are some factors in there that still need to be worked out, but in theory, it is kind of the perfect hybrid model between pure TNC market domination, car ownership, and the rise of AVs. For similar reasons mentioned above when discussing how difficult it would be for TNCs to transition to fleet owners, a lot of current automobile OEMs are extremely well-positioned to take advantage of this possible shift. Example: If Toyota could retrofit the Prius to be autonomous and then set up a TAAS network (maybe in partnership with other OEMs), they could take advantage of their production facilities and all the cars they already own to beat TNCs to the market.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[2,2],2,\"Government Regulation\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"In a lot of ways, the media has painted a classic, “Us vs. Them”, “Government vs. Innovation” story surrounding the development of autonomous vehicles.

Within the consumer space, how we make this move depends on a handful of factors with one of the most prevalent being what automobile ownership looks like moving forward. It has been hypothesized that many people living in cities are already passing on car ownership due to factors such as increasing traffic times and high parking costs. These non-car owners utilize public transportation, walking, and Transport Network Companies (”TNC”<em>— Companies like Lyft and Uber</em>). For many people, the decision not to own a car makes a lot of sense, as <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fcould-self-driving-cars-spell-the-end-of-ownership-1448986572&amp;t=YjY1MWNjOTJiZGZiMTRhNWM3YzdhMWVkMGJmMzIyNGVkOTI2NWJjZixkUnRncnoxYQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F166686866887%2Froadblocks-for-autonomous-vehicles&amp;m=1\">Dan Neil of the Wall Street Journal</a> points out below:</p><blockquote><em>The absurdity of our century-old, ad hoc approach to mobility is captured in one statistic: The utilization rate of automobiles in the U.S. is about 5%. For the remaining 95% of the time (23 hours), our cars just sit there, a slow, awful cash burn, like condos at the beach.</em></blockquote><p>With cars sitting idly for nearly the entire day (traffic spikes occurring during morning and late afternoon commute times on weekdays), it makes sense that Americans would choose to pass on ownership and all the costs associated with it (insurance, maintenance, gas) in exchange for less expensive (public transport), less committal (TNCs), and free (walking) forms of transportation.</p><p>However, contrary to observations of many in urban environments, <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Farticle%2F20161122%2FRETAIL05%2F161129973%2Faverage-age-of-vehicles-on-road-hits-11.6-years&amp;t=N2RjZmQyMGVjN2RlNzIyODA2NDQ0YjIwNmY2YWE3MDdhY2IzZmQzOSxkUnRncnoxYQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F166686866887%2Froadblocks-for-autonomous-vehicles&amp;m=1\">IHS Markit reports</a> that as of January 1, 2016:</p><ul><li>More people own vehicles than in previous years — “registrations for light vehicles in operation in the U.S. hit a record 264 million, an increase of more than 6.2 million, or 2.4 percent [over the previous year].”</li><li>Age of vehicles are increasing — “The average age of light vehicles is now 11.6 years, based on a snapshot of vehicles in operation on Jan. 1, 2016”</li><li>Consumers are keeping their vehicles for longer — “As of the end of 2015, the average length of ownership was 79.3 months — a record — up 1.5 months from the previous year”</li></ul><p>It largely appears ride-sharing services are growing complementary to car ownership rather than as an outright replacement. Outside of urban areas where the supermarket is in walking distance, delivery services like Instacart are common practice (see the map of Instacart markets below), or there are established and dependable public transportation systems, car ownership is still a necessity.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/39cbdb7c66fd9e47a7bacddd363ed7f7/tumblr_inline_oy8uzvt5uX1v3mmrv_500.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"image\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instacart.com%2Flocations&amp;t=NDg1NWJmODdjNWY3ZGQ5N2FiYjZlODQ2MDhmYzZiOWM5OWZkNDg0OCxkUnRncnoxYQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F166686866887%2Froadblocks-for-autonomous-vehicles&amp;m=1\">Instacart Service Areas</a>. I use an Instacart as an example here for a greater trend. Most of the tech-enabled services that are common to the readers of this article are concentrated in urban hubs. There is a good chunk of the country that has never heard of Instacart (and similar services for laundry, house cleaning, dog walking, etc.)</em></p><p>In regards to car ownership, I concede that it difficult to break down. In my research, a lot of the studies I come across that specifically analyze trends in urban areas are from 2013 or earlier (and in my opinion don’t capture the impact of TNCs that really took off in 2014-2015). If any readers have research they could share regarding urban v. suburban v. rural car ownership trends, that would be appreciated. Overall, my opinion is that in urban areas and areas just outside of urban areas, it is logical to see a decrease in car ownership, while in suburban and rural areas, a lot more needs to happen besides just TNCs to have an impact on car ownership.</p><p>There is a hypothetical situation where I can see the ownership trend being reversed, but it involves at least two difficult factors (miracles) to line up. For me, the thought of a $5 Lyft to Safeway and a $5 Lyft home from Safeway seems like an avoidable double-digit added tax on top of my grocery bill. However, if that ride was only $1 — $3 each way, I would be more open-minded. That’s where autonomous vehicles come in.

It should not be understated how big of a shift this would be. While no TNC company slide decks are leaked online, one can imagine what a key investment point into a company like Uber or Lyft is… capital efficiency! I will not attempt the math here (maybe a project for another time), but if there are currently 45,000 Uber and Lyft drivers in SF, let’s assume (naively) 50/50 for each company and that at bare minimum an AV would be $20K (again a naïve estimate), that means each company would have to shell out $450 M just to get an AV market built out in SF. This estimate doesn’t even include other ancillary costs of car ownership like insurance, parking, gas (people often interpret the rise in AVs as a simultaneous rise in electric and battery-powered vehicles, but that isn’t true in a 1:1 sense)</p><p>Okay. So, there’s a lot of difficulties surrounding bringing TNCs to market as the leading form of autonomous transportation. For non-autonomous cars to lead the way in the transportation-as-a-service (”TAAS”) market, a lot of people still need to own cars to be able to provide service to those that don’t. In the autonomous realm, TNCs need to be willing to make HUGE capital investments to bring large autonomous fleets to consumers. Then there’s a third scenario (not yet explored) in which a % of consumers own AVs and have them <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Felectrek.co%2F2016%2F10%2F28%2Ftesla-model-3-self-drivin-ride-tesla-network-cost-per-mile%2F&amp;t=YjliNzRlZTg5MDQ4NzFiYTU5YzE2NThhZGE1NDQ0NjkxZDBjOWQwYyxkUnRncnoxYQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F166686866887%2Froadblocks-for-autonomous-vehicles&amp;m=1\">drive people around</a> (TAAS-style) during the 95% of the day when they’d otherwise be sitting idly. Elon Musk has spoken the most about this and it sounds like a huge incentive to own a Tesla. If your Tesla earned you $50/day chauffeuring others around for the 23 hours you aren’t using it, you could pay the car off in 2 years flat (assuming you drove a no-frills Tesla Model 3). Obviously, there are some factors in there that still need to be worked out, but in theory, it is kind of the perfect hybrid model between pure TNC market domination, car ownership, and the rise of AVs. For similar reasons mentioned above when discussing how difficult it would be for TNCs to transition to fleet owners, a lot of current automobile OEMs are extremely well-positioned to take advantage of this possible shift. Example: If Toyota could retrofit the Prius to be autonomous and then set up a TAAS network (maybe in partnership with other OEMs), they could take advantage of their production facilities and all the cars they already own to beat TNCs to the market.</p><p><strong><strong>Government Regulation</strong></strong></p><p>In a lot of ways, the media has painted a classic, “Us vs. Them”, “Government vs. Innovation” story surrounding the development of autonomous vehicles. In my research, this seems to be an inaccurate description of the actual actions taken by the government. While the Uber story of December 2016 where the California DMV revoked registration for self-driving cars due to lack of permits got a lot of attention, it is contrary to the experience other groups have gotten while working with government officials.</p><blockquote>We envision in the future, you can take your hands off the wheel, and your commute becomes restful or productive instead of frustrating and exhausting, said Jeffrey Zients, director of the National Economic Council, adding that highly automated vehicles “will save time, money and lives.” <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F09%2F20%2Ftechnology%2Fsef-driving-cars-guidelines.html%3F_r%3D0&amp;t=MGViNDMxMGQwYWY0N2M5NGEzMjliZDFiMTQxODQ5MzJlM2U1Y2FmYixkUnRncnoxYQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F166686866887%2Froadblocks-for-autonomous-vehicles&amp;m=1\">Source</a></blockquote><p>One <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.aaa.com%2F2017%2F03%2Famericans-feel-unsafe-sharing-road-fully-self-driving-cars%2F&amp;t=MmQ3Mjg5ZTM5MThjYzQ1NWRlZTkzNTYxZmVmMGQwYWNjMDYzMGU5OSxkUnRncnoxYQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F166686866887%2Froadblocks-for-autonomous-vehicles&amp;m=1\">study </a>from AAA points out another instance in which governments can support the consumer adoption of autonomous vehicles:</p><blockquote>Half (54%) of U.S. drivers feel less safe at the prospect of sharing the road with a self-driving vehicle, while one-third (34%) feel it wouldn’t make a differenceand only 10 percent say they would feel safer.</blockquote><p>and that</p><blockquote>Three-quarters (78%) of Americans are afraid to ride in a self-driving vehicle.</blockquote><p>In many ways, support from the government can provide legitimacy to the claims that AV companies are making surrounding improved safety in their vehicles. For that to happen though, developers of autonomous vehicle technology need to be willing to share data with governments.</p><p>This support from the government towards companies developing autonomous cars is not to say that government involvement and regulation are not needed for the industry to be successful long-term. Towards the end of his presidency, speaking to a room of technology entrepreneurs, Barack Obama described the difference between running a tech company and running a country:</p><blockquote>The final thing I’ll say is that government will never run the way Silicon Valley runs because, by definition, democracy is messy. This is a big, diverse country with a lot of interests and a lot of disparate points of view. And part of government’s job, by the way, is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with. […]</blockquote><p>Like with most disruptive technologies, there are those who lose amidst the change and find themselves in a worse position. While it’s easy for groups like Lyft or Uber to continuously think about the longevity of their products and the positive effects that will come from increased adoption and use, it is less plausible that these companies will dedicate time towards highlighting the potential negative consequences that someone less bullish on the product would consider. Without government regulation in place to tax TNC rides, it is not unreasonable to assume a couple things:</p><ul><li>For many, the idea of taking a taxi or black car to work seems ridiculous, but Uber/Lyft change that. The ease and low cost of requesting a ride through a TNC have made this once implausible scenario, possible. Instead of walking 10 blocks or taking public transportation, more people are now using TNCs to travel.</li><li>With the ease of requesting a TNC ride to work, it becomes easier for people to live farther from their offices and outside of cities. Many chose to live in cities or suburbs because the thought of spending time commuting in and out of the city each day or using public transportation is worse than high city rent prices. With the rise of TNCs, it becomes much less of a hassle for someone to endure a long commute to work. Commuters can use their time traveling to and from work to read, nap, catch up on e-mails on mobile, or work locally on a laptop. In a lot of ways, human-operated TNCs provide some foreshadowing into what an AV-enabled future could look like. It’s less painful to spend an hour in the car when your hands are free to do whatever you choose because someone else is driving.</li></ul><p>The net effect of these hypothetical scenarios is highlighted in a recent study out of NYC showing that with the rise of TNCs, there are more cars on the road. Some highlights from the February 2017 report, “<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fschallerconsult.com%2Frideservices%2Funsustainable.htm&amp;t=YzM1NDU2NTFlNzM0YmVlZWZmZmMzNzg3M2QyMjg3MTI3NGY0NWNhZixkUnRncnoxYQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F166686866887%2Froadblocks-for-autonomous-vehicles&amp;m=1\">Unsustainable?

Migration from public transit translates to increased mileage even if the trips are shared.</li><li>In 2015 and to an even greater extent in 2016, growth in taxi and for-hire ridership outpaced growth in transit (subway and bus) ridership and is now the leading source of growth in non-auto travel in New York City. This marks a reversal from the transit-oriented growth that lasted from 1990 to 2014.</li><li>TNCs accounted for the addition of 600 million miles of vehicular travel to the city’s roadway network over the past three years</li><li>Trip growth in Manhattan has been concentrated during the morning and evening peak periods when yellow cab shift changes produced a shortage of cab availability, and late evenings and weekends when passengers may prefer the comfort and convenience of TNCs over yellow cabs or transit services”</li></ol><p>I encourage everyone reading this to read the entire report as it covers a lot more than my select highlights above. However, the 5 points above summarize the message that I am trying to convey here and are a demonstration of some of the reasons government regulation is needed. In the summer of 2015, Uber <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.uber.com%2Fus-new-york%2Ftaking-1-million-cars-off-the-road-in-new-york-city%2F&amp;t=ODUyMTE5OWI1YmYwMjQ4NDRjYmRmMTVlN2M3ZjhiZjFjYTQzNDlkMSxkUnRncnoxYQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F166686866887%2Froadblocks-for-autonomous-vehicles&amp;m=1\">announced</a>:</p><blockquote>With UberPOOL, our goal is simple: take 1 million cars off the road in New York City and help eliminate our city’s congestion problem for good. We want to do our part and invest in creating a less congested, greener future for New York City.</blockquote><p>1.5 years later, the aforementioned NYC report has shown the exact opposite. Bullets 1–4 above demonstrate that more rides are being taken, people are switching from public transport and walking/biking to TNCs, and TNC usage is outpacing public transportation growth. Bullet 5 speaks directly to the second point that I make above. There are peak hours where the number of TNCs on the road can’t meet the number of requests coming in. Surge charges aside, what this also means is that people who used to walk and use public transport are now using TNCs and in turn, there is more traffic during hours that were already the most crowded no the roads (morning commute, evening commute, and weekend bar hours)</p><p><strong><strong>Technology Overlap</strong></strong></p><p><em>*Disclaimer: I am not a technical expert on AVs so if something is blatantly wrong here, please flag it to me*</em></p><p>“There is a presumption that autonomous vehicles will decrease the number of accidents on the road, is that true?” To many this claim raises eyebrows.</p><p>There are a lot of moving parts when it comes to safe and successful implementation of AVs on the road. As I alluded to in my opening, it is easy to imagine two Tesla Model 3s communicating with each other, but it’s a lot tougher to imagine a Tesla Model 3 communicating with a drunk driver. It’s getting a lot of buzz, but as I am writing this article, (and just down the street from me at ASU) an Uber self-driving car was t-boned by a manually operated vehicle that failed to yield. “Police were called to a crash at approximately 6:25 p.m. Friday [March 24, 2017] to find that the Uber SUV had been hit when another vehicle failed to yield, according to the Tempe Police Department.

Within the consumer space, how we\nmake this move depends on a handful of factors with one of the most prevalent\nbeing what automobile ownership looks like moving forward. It has been\nhypothesized that many people living in cities are already passing on car\nownership due to factors such as increasing traffic times and high parking\ncosts. These non-car owners utilize public transportation, walking, and\nTransport Network Companies (”TNC”— Companies like Lyft and Uber).

I use an Instacart as an example here for a greater trend. Most of the\ntech-enabled services that are common to the readers of this article are\nconcentrated in urban hubs. There is a good chunk of the country that has never\nheard of Instacart (and similar services for laundry, house cleaning, dog\nwalking, etc.)\n\nIn regards to car ownership, I concede that it difficult to break down. In my\nresearch, a lot of the studies I come across that specifically analyze trends in\nurban areas are from 2013 or earlier (and in my opinion don’t capture the impact\nof TNCs that really took off in 2014-2015). If any readers have research they\ncould share regarding urban v. suburban v. rural car ownership trends, that\nwould be appreciated. Overall, my opinion is that in urban areas and areas just\noutside of urban areas, it is logical to see a decrease in car ownership, while\nin suburban and rural areas, a lot more needs to happen besides just TNCs to\nhave an impact on car ownership.\n\nThere is a hypothetical situation where I can see the ownership trend being\nreversed, but it involves at least two difficult factors (miracles) to line up.\nFor me, the thought of a $5 Lyft to Safeway and a $5 Lyft home from Safeway\nseems like an avoidable double-digit added tax on top of my grocery bill.\nHowever, if that ride was only $1 — $3 each way, I would be more open-minded.\nThat’s where autonomous vehicles come in.

The second assumption that I believe\nis critical to the first assumption is that TNCs own their own fleets of\nautonomous vehicles.

It should not\nbe understated how big of a shift this would be. While no TNC company slide\ndecks are leaked online, one can imagine what a key investment point into a\ncompany like Uber or Lyft is… capital efficiency! I will not attempt the math\nhere (maybe a project for another time), but if there are currently 45,000 Uber\nand Lyft drivers in SF, let’s assume (naively) 50/50 for each company and that\nat bare minimum an AV would be $20K (again a naïve estimate), that means each\ncompany would have to shell out $450 M just to get an AV market built out in SF.\nThis estimate doesn’t even include other ancillary costs of car ownership like\ninsurance, parking, gas (people often interpret the rise in AVs as a\nsimultaneous rise in electric and battery-powered vehicles, but that isn’t true\nin a 1:1 sense)\n\nOkay. So, there’s a lot of difficulties surrounding bringing TNCs to market as\nthe leading form of autonomous transportation. For non-autonomous cars to lead\nthe way in the transportation-as-a-service (”TAAS”) market, a lot of people\nstill need to own cars to be able to provide service to those that don’t. In the\nautonomous realm, TNCs need to be willing to make HUGE capital investments to\nbring large autonomous fleets to consumers. Then there’s a third scenario (not\nyet explored) in which a % of consumers own AVs and have them drive people\naround\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Felectrek.co%2F2016%2F10%2F28%2Ftesla-model-3-self-drivin-ride-tesla-network-cost-per-mile%2F&t=YjliNzRlZTg5MDQ4NzFiYTU5YzE2NThhZGE1NDQ0NjkxZDBjOWQwYyxkUnRncnoxYQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F166686866887%2Froadblocks-for-autonomous-vehicles&m=1] \n(TAAS-style) during the 95% of the day when they’d otherwise be sitting idly.\nElon Musk has spoken the most about this and it sounds like a huge incentive to\nown a Tesla. If your Tesla earned you $50/day chauffeuring others around for the\n23 hours you aren’t using it, you could pay the car off in 2 years flat\n(assuming you drove a no-frills Tesla Model 3). Obviously, there are some\nfactors in there that still need to be worked out, but in theory, it is kind of\nthe perfect hybrid model between pure TNC market domination, car ownership, and\nthe rise of AVs. For similar reasons mentioned above when discussing how\ndifficult it would be for TNCs to transition to fleet owners, a lot of current\nautomobile OEMs are extremely well-positioned to take advantage of this possible\nshift. Example: If Toyota could retrofit the Prius to be autonomous and then set\nup a TAAS network (maybe in partnership with other OEMs), they could take\nadvantage of their production facilities and all the cars they already own to\nbeat TNCs to the market.\n\nGovernment Regulation\n\nIn a lot of ways, the media has painted a classic, “Us vs. Them”, “Government\nvs. Innovation” story surrounding the development of autonomous vehicles. In my\nresearch, this seems to be an inaccurate description of the actual actions taken\nby the government. While the Uber story of December 2016 where the California\nDMV revoked registration for self-driving cars due to lack of permits got a lot\nof attention, it is contrary to the experience other groups have gotten while\nworking with government officials.\n\n> We envision in the future, you can take your hands off the wheel, and your\ncommute becomes restful or productive instead of frustrating and exhausting,\nsaid Jeffrey Zients, director of the National Economic Council, adding that\nhighly automated vehicles “will save time, money and lives.” Source\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F09%2F20%2Ftechnology%2Fsef-driving-cars-guidelines.html%3F_r%3D0&t=MGViNDMxMGQwYWY0N2M5NGEzMjliZDFiMTQxODQ5MzJlM2U1Y2FmYixkUnRncnoxYQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F166686866887%2Froadblocks-for-autonomous-vehicles&m=1]\nOne study\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.aaa.com%2F2017%2F03%2Famericans-feel-unsafe-sharing-road-fully-self-driving-cars%2F&t=MmQ3Mjg5ZTM5MThjYzQ1NWRlZTkzNTYxZmVmMGQwYWNjMDYzMGU5OSxkUnRncnoxYQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F166686866887%2Froadblocks-for-autonomous-vehicles&m=1]\nfrom AAA points out another instance in which governments can support the\nconsumer adoption of autonomous vehicles:\n\n> Half (54%) of U.S. drivers feel less safe at the prospect of sharing the road\nwith a self-driving vehicle, while one-third (34%) feel it wouldn’t make a\ndifferenceand only 10 percent say they would feel safer.\nand that\n\n> Three-quarters (78%) of Americans are afraid to ride in a self-driving vehicle.\nIn many ways, support from the government can provide legitimacy to the claims\nthat AV companies are making surrounding improved safety in their vehicles. For\nthat to happen though, developers of autonomous vehicle technology need to be\nwilling to share data with governments.\n\nThis support from the government towards companies developing autonomous cars is\nnot to say that government involvement and regulation are not needed for the\nindustry to be successful long-term. Towards the end of his presidency, speaking\nto a room of technology entrepreneurs, Barack Obama described the difference\nbetween running a tech company and running a country:\n\n> The final thing I’ll say is that government will never run the way Silicon\nValley runs because, by definition, democracy is messy. This is a big, diverse\ncountry with a lot of interests and a lot of disparate points of view. And part\nof government’s job, by the way, is dealing with problems that nobody else wants\nto deal with. […]\nLike with most disruptive technologies, there are those who lose amidst the\nchange and find themselves in a worse position. While it’s easy for groups like\nLyft or Uber to continuously think about the longevity of their products and the\npositive effects that will come from increased adoption and use, it is less\nplausible that these companies will dedicate time towards highlighting the\npotential negative consequences that someone less bullish on the product would\nconsider. Without government regulation in place to tax TNC rides, it is not\nunreasonable to assume a couple things:\n\n * For many, the idea of taking a taxi or black car to work seems ridiculous,\n   but Uber/Lyft change that. The ease and low cost of requesting a ride through\n   a TNC have made this once implausible scenario, possible. Instead of walking\n   10 blocks or taking public transportation, more people are now using TNCs to\n   travel.\n * With the ease of requesting a TNC ride to work, it becomes easier for people\n   to live farther from their offices and outside of cities. Many chose to live\n   in cities or suburbs because the thought of spending time commuting in and\n   out of the city each day or using public transportation is worse than high\n   city rent prices. With the rise of TNCs, it becomes much less of a hassle for\n   someone to endure a long commute to work. Commuters can use their time\n   traveling to and from work to read, nap, catch up on e-mails on mobile, or\n   work locally on a laptop. In a lot of ways, human-operated TNCs provide some\n   foreshadowing into what an AV-enabled future could look like. It’s less\n   painful to spend an hour in the car when your hands are free to do whatever\n   you choose because someone else is driving.\n\nThe net effect of these hypothetical scenarios is highlighted in a recent study\nout of NYC showing that with the rise of TNCs, there are more cars on the road.\nSome highlights from the February 2017 report, “Unsustainable?

[…] TNC mileage nonetheless continues to grow rapidly because exclusive-ride\n    trips still predominate, and because most TNC customers are coming from\n    transit, walking, and biking. Migration from public transit translates to\n    increased mileage even if the trips are shared.\n 3. In 2015 and to an even greater extent in 2016, growth in taxi and for-hire\n    ridership outpaced growth in transit (subway and bus) ridership and is now\n    the leading source of growth in non-auto travel in New York City.

However, the 5 points above summarize the\nmessage that I am trying to convey here and are a demonstration of some of the\nreasons government regulation is needed.

We want to do\nour part and invest in creating a less congested, greener future for New York\nCity.\n1.5 years later, the aforementioned NYC report has shown the exact opposite.\nBullets 1–4 above demonstrate that more rides are being taken, people are\nswitching from public transport and walking/biking to TNCs, and TNC usage is\noutpacing public transportation growth. Bullet 5 speaks directly to the second\npoint that I make above. There are peak hours where the number of TNCs on the\nroad can’t meet the number of requests coming in. Surge charges aside, what this\nalso means is that people who used to walk and use public transport are now\nusing TNCs and in turn, there is more traffic during hours that were already the\nmost crowded no the roads (morning commute, evening commute, and weekend bar\nhours)\n\nTechnology Overlap\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a technical expert on AVs so if something is blatantly\nwrong here, please flag it to me*\n\n“There is a presumption that autonomous vehicles will decrease the number of\naccidents on the road, is that true?” To many this claim raises eyebrows.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts when it comes to safe and successful\nimplementation of AVs on the road. As I alluded to in my opening, it is easy to\nimagine two Tesla Model 3s communicating with each other, but it’s a lot tougher\nto imagine a Tesla Model 3 communicating with a drunk driver. It’s getting a lot\nof buzz, but as I am writing this article, (and just down the street from me at\nASU) an Uber self-driving car was t-boned by a manually operated vehicle that\nfailed to yield. “Police were called to a crash at approximately 6:25 p.m.\nFriday [March 24, 2017] to find that the Uber SUV had been hit when another\nvehicle failed to yield, according to the Tempe Police Department. No serious\ninjuries were reported.”\n\nSource: Twitter [https://twitter.com/fresconews/status/845475784563281922] (You\ncan see the LIDAR on top of the Volvo)\n\n\nFrom what I can see, there is no fault to Uber in this incident, but in an\nindirect way it contributes to the point I am trying to make here: while AVs may\nobjectively be safer than human drivers on a test track or in an AV-only world,\nhow much safer are they in a world of human drivers and AVs?\n\nThe other issue that makes AV implementation difficult at scale is that in the\ncurrent ecosystem, there is limited communication between developers of the\ntechnology. This leads to a lack of industry standards and does not create a\nclear path for inter-company vehicle communication. Again, this is a role that\nthe government may need to fill. As much as it will come off as slowing\ninnovation, governments may need to come in and set standards for\nvehicle-to-vehicle communication and another AV regulations to ensure the safest\nexperience for pedestrians and others on the road.\n\nPrior to typing this post, I was very bullish on the speed at which autonomous\nvehicles would be on road, in bulk.

At each step of this evolution, the pool and\ncriteria to pick people from has gotten more and more exclusive and detailed.\n\n * Eharmony uses it’s “matchmaking algorithm” to match you to people it thinks\n   you would fit well with\n * Tinder then used the double opt-in method in which they did not play\n   matchmaker, but only allowed people to talk after the man and woman both\n   “swiped right” (liked) each other.\n * Hinge took this a level deeper and had people answer questions on their\n   profile such as “what is your dream vacation?”, “what is something about you\n   no one else knows?”, “what do you look for in a partner?” so that people\n   would go a level deeper than the often “vain” approach Tinder used based on\n   just looks.\n * Bumble made the process even more exclusive as only women were allowed to\n   send the first message.\n * The League has now taken it to the farthest extreme by adding prospective\n   members to a waitlist to join (whether real or false scarcity, I am unsure).\n\nIn social media, Snapchat has gone out of their way to maintain exclusivity in\ntheir platform. Snap’s original product was a non-public messaging platform for\na smaller circle of trusted friends. And it is extremely popular especially\namongst young Americans (source\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emarketer.com%2FChart%2FUS-Snapchat-User-Penetration-by-Age-2017-of-social-network-users-each-group%2F207836&t=YjBkOTcwYTc1ZWVmMzk3M2YyNzFjYjVmMDcxNjIzMTE0OGY2MGFlYixwbHpPUDVucA%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F167640277737%2Fstrength-in-small-networks&m=1]\n) that opted not to become members on Facebook (anecdotally, my two little\nsisters have Snap, Twitter, Instagram, but no Facebook).  I think the rise in\npopularity of FB groups is also evidence of this trend. People want smaller\ncommunities, not larger ones. **I would also like to compare the frequency of\nposting between Snapchat and Instagram stories. (I.e., I know Instagram stories\nare growing, BUT I would maybe argue that Snap users post more often because\nInstagram stories are still inherently way more open than Snap stories). **\n\nOne of the reasons that Snap flourished was because, as Evan Spiegel has talked\nabout, the product is focused on authentic user content and tried (for as long\nas it could before going public and having to answer to Wall Street) to keep\nadvertisers and “Influencers” off/limited on the platform.\n\nWhen you first make these social media sites you are excited and want to grow\nthem fast, but now myself and others go and unfriend people. I am going out of\nmy way to shrink my network and create a personal environment. I feel that a lot\nof people (unless they are trying to become “social media influencers”) follow\nthe same trend. Patrick Collison (CEO, Stripe) noticed a similar trend (image\nbelow).\n\nAnother example of this idea of limited networks comes from 21.co (now,\nearn.com). 21.co enables users to email list of subject matter experts\n21.co/lists - rather than blasting giant mailing campaigns, paying an agency to\nsurvey dozens of households,  you can instead survey hundreds of SMEs on topics\nand receive answers directly from them.\n\nThe question that arises as an investor, is what are the underlying causes of\nthis shift? Do people want more privacy? Do people want small niche groups for\nall their interests? Are people becoming more introverted and in turn, don’t\nwant to interact with the masses?\n\nAdditionally, what are the consequences of this change? The one that immediately\ncomes to mind is larger filter bubbles and less experience with diverse views.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-07T21:42:42.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T21:43:13.000Z","published_at":"2017-11-18T22:42:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f04ec9f4e0ddd003912e524","uuid":"42cd8283-4c80-4dac-a468-777434c96ce2","title":"Yang 2020","slug":"yang-2020","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ef636e047ef8bd5d5426d5e0748bef1/tumblr_inline_psidntpG5I1v3mmrv_500.png\",\"alt\":\"image\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/854169d84cab46c5d46d4c4c64267af5/tumblr_inline_psidoeu57x1v3mmrv_500.png\",\"alt\":\"image\",\"title\":\"\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/98661094242489fe33ceb97578680097/tumblr_inline_psidu8RKLl1v3mmrv_500.png\",\"alt\":\"image\",\"title\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/primalpoly/status/1070192929971392513\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-DHuRTvzMFw&t=OTE3ZmE1ODE5MzAxNjE1ODM4NDBkNDYwYmM3YzA3NzM3YjBmOWQxMSxHY2d0SGVYeQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F185333373122%2Fyang-2020&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DjyoXG2IfgiM&t=ZmMwNGJlMjczNDBhNTdmYzY0NGU2MzI2OGJmYTgwZTc4MmM5OTc2ZSxHY2d0SGVYeQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F185333373122%2Fyang-2020&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailydot.com%2Flayer8%2Fkamala-harris-apron-conspiracy-theories%2F&t=OTNkMGVjYThjMWQzMTQzNDc5NjZkYjAwM2NjNDMyMGE5Y2MxODliYyxHY2d0SGVYeQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F185333373122%2Fyang-2020&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtjDEPtS68CM&t=NDE0MjM0NDFkOWNhZGIyNzA3ZWIwYmM5MGFkNzM1NGJjOGMxMWU4YSxHY2d0SGVYeQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F185333373122%2Fyang-2020&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/ComfortablySmug/status/1088155121085833216\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-us-canada-47096767&t=NjRjZGRlYWZkZTE1OWI3NTk5MjViNGNkOGZhMTNjN2ViOGUzOWE1ZCxHY2d0SGVYeQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F185333373122%2Fyang-2020&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fjoebiden.info%2F&t=NjNlZGZiNzEwZmI1ZDdkYjJlYTVmNDE2OGY0M2E4ODc3ZmY2OGYwZCxHY2d0SGVYeQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F185333373122%2Fyang-2020&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1117574734504439808\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yang2020.com%2Fpolicies%2F&t=YzNlZWI0YzEzNmU5ZjdiNzVjOWFhZDQ2MWVhN2Q3MDI5ZjA2NzU0NSxHY2d0SGVYeQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F185333373122%2Fyang-2020&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fandrew-yang-neeraj-agarwal-consensus-2019&t=NWY3MWYxYjY4MDBjOGMxNDNmNzcxZWNkMGE5OTIyMzU3M2FmOTc1OSxHY2d0SGVYeQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F185333373122%2Fyang-2020&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/primalpoly/status/1046101490677555205\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Planting this flag.

Substack connects writers\nand readers then takes a 10% cut of the revenue. Shopify connects merchants and\nbuyers and then charges merchants a monthly subscription fee to use its tech\nalong with offering optional value-add services (payments, lines of credit,\netc.).\n\nUltimately it’s up to the writer or merchant to acquire their own users and\ndistribution.\n\nAggregators are companies like Google or Facebook that intermediate a\nrelationship between third-parties and users. An oversimplification, but\nFacebook and Google have a lot of information about their users and leverage\nthat to get companies to spend advertiser dollars with them. In many cases,\nmedia companies or travel companies don’t own the customer relationship and have\nto pay money to Google and Facebook for distribution.\n\nIf you were planning a trip to Tokyo, you probably start your search in Google,\nrather than on Expedia. As a result, Expedia spent\n[https://www.phocuswire.com/booking-holdings-expedia-group-marketing-spend-2019#:~:text=News%20%7C%20Online-,Expedia%20Group%2C%20Booking%20Holdings%20spent%20more%20than%20%2411B%20on,mostly%20to%20Google)%20in%202019&text=The%20Norwalk%2C%20Connecticut%2Dbased%20company,to%20%244.41%20billion%20in%202019.] \n$6.03 billion in “selling and marketing” in 2019, mostly towards Google ads.\n\nIn CeFi crypto, Binance is probably the most analogous to a Facebook or Google\nin terms of being an “aggregator”. With 15,000,000+ users, Binance has achieved\nsome of crypto’s best distribution and in turn, has extracted a lot of value\n($$) from suppliers (projects that want to list on Binance).\n\nProject teams (suppliers) are willing to pay Binance in a few ways including\nfees to list on the exchange, a percentage of their IEO funds raised, and\nadvertising (airdrops\n[https://medium.com/harmony-one/harmony-25-000-000-one-token-airdrop-on-binance-dex-a728e5fa646d] \nand giveaways\n[https://decrypt.co/31585/binance-to-give-away-tesla-cybertruck-again-and-28000]\n). Teams are willing to pay Binance in all these ways because it’s unlikely\nthey’d be able to achieve such a wide distribution on their own. Being listed on\nBinance also gives projects added legitimacy because users assume Binance\nconducted some due diligence before adding support.\n\nBinance’s strong stance in the cryptocurrency space, with its branding, users,\nand maturity, allows them to bring products to market later than competitors,\nbut still maintain a very large market share. Binance regularly lists tokens\nafter other exchanges, got into the perpetual futures market later, and only\nrecently started providing options (albeit still one-sided). Despite this,\nBinance’s offerings attract a lot of users.\n\nTo apply aggregation theory to DeFi, at present, we see DeFi as having:\n * Protocols (Third-Parties): Compound [https://compound.finance/], dYdX\n   [https://dydx.exchange/], Maker/DSR [https://makerdao.com/en/], CurveFi\n   [https://www.curve.fi/], Uniswap [https://uniswap.org/]\n * Platforms: Zerion [https://zerion.io/], InstaDapp [https://instadapp.io/], \n   Argent [https://www.argent.xyz/]\n * And an emerging class of aggregators: Ray [https://staking.staked.us/ray], \n   CurveFi [https://www.curve.fi/], 1inch.exchange [https://1inch.exchange/], \n   dex.blue [https://dex.blue/], unspent.io [https://unspent.io/]\n\nTo use an overused analogy, DeFi now is still in its “early internet days”. No\none has come in and aggregated all the services in a meaningful way. Compound,\nfor example, has more users\n[https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/TKSX93XXjf8S9iEHsdccZMPMYrywV3rhPYVv5KBP] \ndirectly interfacing with their protocol than any of the platforms or\naggregation services do.\n\nThe current aggregators also don’t fit exactly with Ben Thompson’s definition,\nbut if you squint really hard, you can see a hint of how they get there.\n\nThe Opportunity\nWe believe there is an opportunity for one of the currently neutral,\nUI/UX-focused platforms like Zerion, InstaDapp, Argent, or a brand new company\nto create an interface that simplifies the DeFi experience and become a\nfull-blown aggregator in the process.\n\nThe current set of aggregators are still not that easy to use, and unlike tech\nindustry aggregators, they’ve so far only aggregated suppliers and have not yet\nsucceeded in aggregating users.\n\nCrypto wallets are, in some ways, playing this role right now. Trust Wallet\n[https://trustwallet.com/], for example, can be used to hold your assets and\nalso offers limited trade functionality, the ability to stake assets, and to\nconnect with other apps via Wallet Connect [https://walletconnect.org/]. But, as\nfar as we know, they make no money.\n\nThe first platform to become ‘THE DeFi platform’ will monopolize the market.\nMetamask is a prime example of what happens when a good enough tool comes out\nearlier than others and becomes a recognized brand name. Almost every single\nDeFi product out there implements MetaMask first. Not having a “log in with\nMetaMask” option on your website can be seen as a sign of project immaturity.\n\nWe propose a few paths for how a DeFi project could become an aggregator:\n\n\nPath One\n\nA platform could turn into more of a ‘trusted marketplace’ or app store for DeFi\nfinancial opportunities. The platform connects users with any number of\nfinancial opportunities and is giving some “stamp of approval” to the protocols\nthey support, saying to users that, to the best of their ability, they verified\nthat the code is legit and checked the audits.\n\nAmazon does something similar with third-party merchants where Amazon charges\nmerchant partners per-transaction fees along with a monthly subscription fee to\nbe able to sell on the Amazon platform.\n\nAdmittedly, the platform would struggle to charge “merchants”\n(protocols/products) a monthly subscription fee (how could you bill Compound?),\nbut it could monetize in other ways.\n\nIt might be possible to charge new products (prior to full decentralization\n[https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-community-ownership-ee0ed1252cc3]\n?) a fee to be officially supported (like in the earlier Binance example). There\nare a lot of new DeFi apps competing for users’ attention. Support on the\nplatform with the most users could be worth a lot of value marketing-wise to a\nnew team.\n\nAnother company that has done this is Salesforce. Salesforce captured users, and\nthen provided a way for other companies to integrate their services inside of\nSalesforce via AppExchange\n[https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/appexchange/faq/]. With AppExchange,\nSalesforce charges a one-time listing fee (to cover security review) and then a\npercentage of revenue for subscriptions that originate through their platform.\n\nA DeFi aggregator with a large user base would be in a perfect position to\nprovide APIs and SDKs for DeFi protocols to integrate with them.\n\nPath Two\n\nThe above suggestions bring up a question about scale. Will DeFi have as many\napps as Amazon does third-party merchants or as Salesforce does in AppExchange?\nUnlikely. The way for a platform to account for this is to put forwards a\n‘freemium’ model.\n\nFor retail users, the platform could take a cut of interest generated or a small\nbps fee on top of transactions by using an intermediary smart contract between\nthe user and the actual protocol. For the users, this translates into a\n“convenience fee”.\n\nIn tandem, the platform could offer a “pro” version of the tool (e.g.,\n$500/month) with no “convenience fees”, more features, and more extensibility\n(e.g., pro-users can integrate with new products on their own through the\nplatform UI, etc.).\n\nThis pro tool could look more like that of a Prime Brokerage, tailored to\ninstitutional clients. Prime brokerage is a bit of an amorphous term, but in\ntraditional finance, it is a bundle of financial services generally offered by\nbanks to hedge funds. The services range from borrowing for leveraged trading or\nshorting, trade execution, cash management, fundraising introductions, advisory\nservices, etc.\n\nIn CeFi crypto, there has been a lot of excitement towards companies building\nprime brokerages (e.g., Tagomi), but most have not succeeded because:\n\n * In traditional markets, it would be near impossible for a hedge fund to raise\n   from institutional investors without a prime broker, but that’s not the case\n   in crypto so the overall need is lower\n * Some of the Alpha in crypto actually comes from taking advantage of exchange\n   infrastructure infancy so funds want to be connected to all platforms\n   directly\n * Prime Brokers have not been able to provide their customers with borrowing\n   and lending (which many would argue is the most important function)\n * Even if a Prime Broker was offering margin in their native UI, the funds\n   would still need to post unique collateral for each exchange (i.e.,\n   collateral posted on Huobi would not be recognized on OKEx)\n\nThe role a DeFi aggregator could take here would be putting borrowing and\nlending (to start via Compound or Aave) next to trading opportunities. In\nreality, this means that market makers are borrowing on one platform to lend on\nanother (similar to CeFi Prime Brokers), but in practice, this might look more\nlike a unified trading experience similar to a traditional prime brokerage.\n\nThe aggregator could also consider rolling out its own CeFi or P2P lending\nopportunity where it would be easier to take a spread. There’s also always the\npossibility of taking an approach like Amazon has with their AmazonBasics\n[https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazons-treatment-third-party-sellers-became-antitrust-target-us-abroad/] \nline of creating their own versions of the most successful products.\n\nUltimately, one of the platforms going for a full vertical integration of\nservices would lead to a “winner takes most\n[https://avc.com/2015/10/winner-takes-most/]” type scenario where platform would\nstreamline the process for users, in the process accruing most of the value for\ntheir platform.\n\nWhat are the upsides?\nThe upsides of these platform aggregators is that it would help make DeFi\naccessible to a wider audience. The activation cost of using DeFi for the first\ntime is very high. Even for people who have been in crypto for a long time,\nthese platforms can be difficult to deal with.\n\nNew aggregators with nice UIs and abstraction away from the nitty-gritty can\ncatalyze the inflow of newcomers to DeFi, similar to what Coinbase did for\ncrypto in late 2017.\n\nA lot of people approaching DeFi for the first time are intimidated when they\nactually go to try it out. You can imagine a generally intelligent person who\nreads on Twitter that they can get 8% on their dollars. So they go over to\nDeFi_Product only to realize that they first need to go somewhere else to\nconvert their dollars into a stablecoin, then they need to set up a wallet at a\ndifferent website before they can actually use their dollars on DeFi_Product.\n\nThere is a ton of room for product improvement in DeFi and it makes sense for\nthat to happen at the platform/aggregator level so that products can continue to\nfocus on technical improvement and security.\n\nWhat are the downsides?\nEverything comes with risk. If you were using Instadapp, which was using\ndex.blue to execute a trade on Uniswap, you might be three layers (and multiple\nsmart contracts) removed from the actual trade. More abstraction makes it less\nlikely that users actually understand what they are using. This veil of safety\ncan be dangerous in a nascent industry still\n[https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-lending-protocol-bzx-hacked-twice-in-a-matter-of-days] \n prone [https://decrypt.co/26033/dforce-lendfme-defi-hack-25m] to\n[https://medium.com/@1inch.exchange/balancer-hack-2020-a8f7131c980e] hacks\n[https://defirate.com/imbtc-uniswap-hack/]. Simplicity is king when making a\nhack-resistant protocol.\n\nThe more layers away the user is from their own money, the more likely it is for\na security flaw to exist. Additionally, it becomes more and more difficult for\naggregators to audit the entire ecosystem when things become more and more\nintertwined. The BZX hack was a great example of what happens when multiple\npieces of DeFi get mixed together.\n\nImage Source: Deribit remake of ‘The Simpsons – Nuclear scene’ (Fox Broadcasting\nCorp.)Looking at 1inch trades, the money usually flows like this for a DAI to\nUSDT trade:\n\n 1. User sends DAI to 1inch\n 2. 1inch sends DAI to curve.fi pool 1\n 3. Curve.fi pool 1 deposits DAI in iearn.finance\n 4. iearn.finance has USDT withdrawn to curve.fi pool 2\n 5. Curve.fi pool 2 sends USDT to 1inch\n 6. 1inch sends USDT to the user\n\nThere are two consequences of the above flow to be aware of:\n\nFirst, someone hacking iearn.finance might be able to steal funds from users who\nhave approved 1inch’s smart contract to move their ERC20 tokens, since 1inch has\napproved curve.fi, and curve.fi has approved iearn.finance. Those users might\nnot even know iearn.finance exists!\n\nSecond, In Ethereum’s current form, gas costs make aggregation prohibitively\nexpensive. For example, this\n[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5d2a4aa3f5f08e3c10270404912471e69e9177f10b27533ad50f266c56267784] \n1inch transaction came with nearly $10 in fees.

Right\nnow, to exchange DAI/USDT, gas fees for using the combination of 1inch and\nCurveFi are about 6x Uniswap directly ($5.13 vs. $0.855).\n\nConclusion\nThe silver lining here for a DeFi aggregator is that in many ways, they’d be\nable to create a better user-experience and more easily monetize by becoming\nmore centralized. But, in most cases, this defies why these teams began building\nthese projects.

He is nuanced and filled with stories and\nanalogies, not to confuse the reader, but to really try and find the core of his\nown beliefs.\n\nAs a testimony to the positive impact that he has had on people (specifically,\nyoung men) scroll down to the “third letter writer” (Control+F “third”) section\n-https://jordanbpeterson.com/political-correctness/letters/\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fjordanbpeterson.com%2Fpolitical-correctness%2Fletters%2F&t=MGM3MDkxMDNkZTk2MmU0YWM1ZjlkM2E3OTA1ZDFkMGRlNWU2MWIwNSx0b3FiUkhhZw%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F186357940997%2Fbrief-thoughts-on-jordan-peterson&m=1]","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1566669437687-7040a6926753?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-10T21:49:25.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-20T04:14:49.000Z","published_at":"2019-07-17T21:50:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f08e2c07f9c38003941e63e","uuid":"14d75b78-48d5-451f-aa1f-82a753348729","title":"Calendar Auditing","slug":"calendar-auditing","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f8264418356839e2a1bf1cb4e16b185/5149b6440d87f52f-8c/s500x750/112237b38790b9e16c72dc12f98b74bc4716fc08.png\",\"alt\":\"image\",\"title\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fQHLK1aIBs\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://genius.com/Keith-rabois-lecture-14-how-to-operate-annotated\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dyy_VAzwzojXz6G3Sd164HuPal0SipLkFtdukOcc49o/edit#gid=0\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I listened to Keith Rabois’s “How to Operate” (\"],[0,[0],1,\"Video\"],[0,[],0,\", \"],[0,[1],1,\"Transcript\"],[0,[],0,\") a while back and learned about the simple concept of a “Calendar Audit”.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[2,2],2,\"Keith Rabois:\"]]],[1,\"blockquote\",[[0,[3],1,\"Actually, what I would recommend is doing what I call a calendar audit.

This\n   isn’t relevant to me right now, but could be relevant to me in the future if\n   I am working on marketing projects so I save it to an Evernote file.\n * Leave: I came across this interesting photo\n   [https://twitter.com/Crazyinnasia/status/1195556228233072640?s=20] of how a\n   restaurant in Bangkok deals with square foot constraints. I have no idea what\n   I will do with this knowledge, but it’s interesting enough that I kind of\n   wanted to have it engrained in my mind\n\nCapturing\n\nFor a while, the regret I had with using Twitter was that I would be reading a\nlot of great content and advice, but it would be fleeting. For every 100 tweets\nI read, maybe I would remember 1.\n\n * So, over the past year, when I find individual tweets that contain\n   interesting ideas on specific topics that I want to come back to, I move them\n   over to Evernote and tag them so that I can easily find and return to them.\n   In my case, most of these tweets and tags are related to company building\n   functions (marketing, hiring, etc.)\n * My most used Evernote file is one called “Startup Tweets” and it has sections\n   like “Choosing a Founding Team”, “Culture”, “Sales/Marketing” and under each\n   there are tweets I’ve seen with interesting tidbits of advice or ideas.\n * Some that I have cataloged that I come back to often:\n * On radical transparency (link\n   [https://twitter.com/AliBHamed/status/1057597444316389376])\n * Thinking about startup culture as a set of sliders (link\n   [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1092555950404231168?s=20])\n * BigCos and distribution (link\n   [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1165477506901659648?s=20])\n\nHow I Use Other Social Networks\n\n * I use other social media platforms pretty scarcely.\n * Facebook and LinkedIn are both utilities to me. LinkedIn acts as my online\n   resume and a way to be notified when friends move roles. Facebook is for\n   being reminded of people’s birthdays and the groups features. On Facebook my\n   newsfeed is completely blank because I went in and unfollowed every group and\n   person I am friends with on Facebook. This was so that I never get distracted\n   by the Facebook newsfeed when I go to check birthdays. I learned afterward\n   that there are also Chrome extensions\n   [https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore%2Fdetail%2Fnews-feed-eradicator-for%2Ffjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg%3Fhl%3Den&t=NzY0YzIzOGY3NTliYjk2MjExM2NhYmExOWI2NmI2NTYxZTBkMjg0YixhNU5jWENUYw%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F189846358317%2Fhow-i-use-twitter&m=1] \n   that do this. I still like my method best because even though it took ~2\n   hours upfront, it’s basically impossible to walk the decision back, whereas\n   it is easy to disable a chrome extension.\n * Instagram I recently made while I was living in Asia because I was taking a\n   lot of cool pictures that I wanted to easily share with friends and family. I\n   do not follow anyone on Instagram for the same reason as blank newsfeed on\n   Facebook…. I don’t need more distractions.\n * Oddly, my 2nd most used social network is probably WeChat. They have a\n   feature called “Moments” which is like a Twitter feed among your contacts.\n   From my time living and working in Asia, I have a lot of friends where\n   Moments is their primary posting channel.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551817958-20204d6ab212?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-10T21:53:18.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-20T04:17:27.000Z","published_at":"2019-12-24T22:55:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f08e40e7f9c38003941e662","uuid":"526dd0ae-f9cc-4ec1-b62f-4544a86abe32","title":"Reflections on 2019","slug":"reflections-on-2019","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5xH0HfJHsaY&t=Mzg3NmEyNmJjMWE4Yzk2MTg3YjdiZWEzMWU0NThkOTg2OTU0ZGExZCwyeFd4enM1Sg%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F189987583482%2Freflections-on-2019&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F679418.Cable_Cowboy&t=NWU4NzA0MGU4MzJhNWVhMzUyNDM0NjZiYjZiNjQwZjI3NGEyY2QyYSwyeFd4enM1Sg%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F189987583482%2Freflections-on-2019&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F38796298-dignity&t=YzQ0MmExMzcxYmYxNWFiZmVjMzRhYTY4MDE1M2ZmYmU3YTBlODA3MiwyeFd4enM1Sg%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F189987583482%2Freflections-on-2019&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fchannel%2FUCR85PW_B_7_Aisx5vNS7Gjw&t=ZDIyMDgzMGQ0YTQ3ZmE2ZGFmNzg3MTllMTk2NDI2YzVjNGU0NzBkNywyeFd4enM1Sg%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F189987583482%2Freflections-on-2019&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLove%2C_Death_%2526_Robots&t=ZDY3MDY3NTU5NTNhYjRhYWYxMTRjYTY3NTAxOTBmMjA2YzJmOWZkNSwyeFd4enM1Sg%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F189987583482%2Freflections-on-2019&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D28hYUZMufDg&t=OGY5MmYwN2JlNmEyNmNkNWMxMGQ2NzQxZTk5MTQzNjg2NjM4NmE2ZiwyeFd4enM1Sg%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F189987583482%2Freflections-on-2019&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpeHvj5TedFI%26list%3DPLD8lj82m2VI7t_WK0-Ja2Ze6-NCiApszE%26index%3D4&t=ZmVmMjFkM2Y1NWFiODY0OGEzNzNhNGFmOWNhYWU1MWY1ODUwNjI4NywyeFd4enM1Sg%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F189987583482%2Freflections-on-2019&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlBwtKSrFyjI&t=YmVmNDY4NGJiNzljMGVmNWRiMmE2OGY5ZTcyNTRhM2RjMjBjMmI1NywyeFd4enM1Sg%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F189987583482%2Freflections-on-2019&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSlbVgjFvE3I&t=ZTVkNWQ2NDdjMzNhZTIyMGM4ZWZjMzcwNzAzYmFmY2JiNjNmZTBlZSwyeFd4enM1Sg%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F189987583482%2Freflections-on-2019&m=1\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"2019 was a good year and I am looking forward to a lot of change in 2020.

I spent a good portion of\n     2019 (and late 2018) living in Asia full-time for work in Hong Kong, China,\n     and Korea.

I am making an\n     effort to spend more time with a few people, while still being open to\n     meeting many people.

I will\n     never make the mistake of overlooking this again\n 5.  If you are lucky, the best kind of business to be in is one where you\n     really love your customers and the people you are selling to/building\n     products. There were many times this year when I felt that and it was a\n     great feeling.\n 6.  Writing, both in public (blog, etc.) and in private (internal company\n     docs), is one of the most powerful ways to convey your thinking, 10x your\n     ability, and get in front of a broad audience who might not otherwise see\n     your thoughts\n 7.  Dedicating time to think is a good use of time.

As a practice, I have found\n     that when I spend dedicated time doing this that I am able to generalize\n     and share my thoughts at a much higher level.\n 8.  A lesson I am always relearning in different ways… keeping great care of\n     your health is super important. Dieting well, working out, having healthy\n     relationships, etc.\n 9.  It’s useful to connect people you know to each other and see how they can\n     benefit each other. Being recognized as a person who can make good\n     connections is a nice place to be in\n 10.

GoodEggs no physical\n    storefronts and has an inventory of high-quality, organic, etc. products\n    that you can have delivered to your home the same day. They seem to be the\n    only player in this market. What I imagine is possible is that existing\n    chains like Safeway (or a startup) could buy up cheap warehouse space, stock\n    inventory Costco-style, and then allow people to place orders online. Over\n    time, they could augment with robotics to make the packaging of items\n    seamless and inexpensive. It seems like what GoodEggs doesn’t have is their\n    own inventory though. I could imagine a startup that creates its own private\n    label products (e.g,. Safeway’s “Signature Select” or Whole Foods “365\n    Everyday Value”) and supplements with other manufacturer brands so that they\n    own the whole value chain. They could either start doing delivery via\n    Instacart or have delivery be a key part of their own company from the\n    start. I have to imagine that in many cases, consumers don’t actually care\n    whether they are buying private label or Clorox. Consumers want the highest\n    quality at the lowest cost. A ‘CloudGrocer’ could be uniquely positioned to\n    deliver this.\n\n *","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542838132-92c53300491e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-10T21:59:21.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-20T04:23:32.000Z","published_at":"2020-03-30T21:59:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f08e4e27f9c38003941e687","uuid":"c5cf70e0-28f9-4469-81c1-eef4c8ddd350","title":"Making Tough Decisions","slug":"making-tough-decisions","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fien97HT7Wpk%3Ft%3D153&t=N2Q1NjRhOGZkZTI1ZjA2ZDZhMWU1NTJhMDFlYmNmNDlhZGQwODMwOCxuNHVEcHp4cg%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F615225053475422208%2Fmaking-tough-decisions&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5NsrwH9I9vE&t=YjE5NjUyYzM1NWViMmVkNmNiNGM2MjZjY2U2OTg5MjhjMjgwZmMxOSxuNHVEcHp4cg%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F615225053475422208%2Fmaking-tough-decisions&m=1\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fcoronavirus-trump-economy.html&t=NzE4MjliM2Y0OGE0ZDU1Y2ZlMjdhYjI4N2Y2YWUwYjhkOWJlNjA0MixuNHVEcHp4cg%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F615225053475422208%2Fmaking-tough-decisions&m=1\"]],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1249005193208795136?s=20\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"In high school, I was talking with a friend about Obama.

adoption of mobile ordering platforms\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"As people are trying to avoid leaving their homes, mobile ordering apps (e.g., Instacart, Uber Eats) have had strong and cheap customer acquisition. As a result of COVID, people will realize that apps like Instacart are not too expensive when you consider time and effort saved and have great user-experiences. I expect a lot of the growth these apps experience during COVID will persist. In a 2017 \"],[0,[1],1,\"blog post\"],[0,[],0,\" (Cntrl+F “Instacart”) I shared a map of cities that Instacart operated in at the time and it was very limited to the coasts and some large cities throughout the rest of the US. At this point, it seems like they’ve\"],[0,[2],1,\" expanded\"],[0,[],0,\" to all 50 states. Instacart is serving a critical role for consumers during COVID and is attracting a lot of new ‘shoppers’ as Uber and Lyft drivers have seen their number of riders drop off a cliff. In the \"],[0,[3],1,\"second bullet of my post on grocery stores\"],[0,[],0,\", I talk about some of the additional accommodations stores should make for Instacart shoppers.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I also believe that companies like Chipotle that have invested in building their own mobile ordering apps will do well during this period. I used the Chipotle mobile app and it had a surprisingly exceptional UI. Aftership created a\"],[0,[4],1,\" Doordash API\"],[0,[],0,\" that companies can use to offer delivery to customers all within their own apps. Ubereats \"],[0,[5],1,\"offers\"],[0,[],0,\" the same service so that restaurants can offer delivery in their own apps. This is great for large restaurant chains (Chipotle, McDonald’s, Starbucks, etc.) that want to own the user experience and data and can then outsource delivery without ever having to require a user to leave their mobile flow.\"]]],[1,\"h3\",[[0,[],0,\"The rise of CloudGrocers:\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I wrote a longer post talking about how grocery stores should react to COVID and how they might change in the future\"],[0,[3],1,\" here\"],[0,[],0,\". The question I keep asking is why are CloudKitchens coming to prominence but CloudGrocers are not? To borrow from my other post, the closest example of this idea is GoodEggs. GoodEggs has no physical storefronts and has an inventory of high-quality, organic, etc. products that you can have delivered to your home the same day. While they seem to be the only real player in this market, their products are\"],[0,[6],1,\" too expensive\"],[0,[],0,\" and do not appeal to a mainstream audience. What I imagine is possible is that existing chains like Safeway (or a startup) could buy up cheap warehouse space, stock inventory Costco-style, and then allow people to place orders online. Over time, they could augment with robotics to make the packaging of items seamless and inexpensive. It seems like what GoodEggs doesn’t have is their own inventory though. I imagine a startup that creates its own private label products (e.g, Safeway’s “Signature Select” or Whole Foods “365 Everyday Value”) and supplements with other manufacturer brands so that they own the whole value chain. They could either start doing delivery via Instacart or have delivery be a key part of their own company from the start. I have to imagine that in many cases, consumers don’t actually care whether they are buying private labels or Clorox. Consumers want the highest quality at the lowest cost. A ‘CloudGrocer’ could be uniquely positioned to deliver this.\"]]],[1,\"h3\",[[0,[],0,\"New Tools for Online Shopping\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"A lot of shopping has already moved online and in the same vein as the last two bullets, I expect to see more and more adoption of online shopping of all kinds across new demographics. With this, companies and startups will need to develop tools to make online shopping even simpler. A friend of mine put together an analysis (that I don’t have permission to share) that highlights some of the mobile e-commerce trends that happened in China during COVID. In China, e-commerce grocery shopping benefitted the most and net new adds to Chinese mobile e-commerce spiked the most for people 30+ in tier 3 and tier 4 cities. With more shopping moving online, it makes sense that tools will continue to emerge to make this process even easier. My friend runs a startup called\"],[0,[7],1,\" Encarte\"],[0,[],0,\" which is an incredibly easy to use Chrome extension that allows for instant checkout on 10,000+ retail sites. Tools like Encarte (think of it as a simpler version of the “Pay with PayPal button”) that bring an “Amazon-like” shopping experience to other sites will be of tremendous benefit to shoppers and independent online retailers.\"]]],[1,\"h3\",[[0,[],0,\"Amazon Continues to Dominate\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Inevitably, Amazon will continue to grow during COVID.

For long-time gym goers like myself, I am finding it surprisingly efficient to workout at home. With the exception of a squat rack/straight bar, I can do everything I would have done in a gym from the comfort of home. Right now, I suspended my gym membership, but given 1-2 more months of working out from home, I might not feel the need to resume my membership post-COVID. The rise of at-home fitness hardware will also make this transition easier for a lot of people. Besides expensive hardware providers like Peloton and Tonal, there are also less expensive options like doorframe pull bars, exercise balls, and kettlebells. For fitness studios, I could see a decrease in gym memberships going either way. For example, because I am no longer paying for a gym membership, I might be more open to paying for a monthly yoga membership or paying money to pick up a new physical hobby (e.g., Archery lessons), but still TBD.\"]]],[1,\"h3\",[[0,[],0,\"Health (and masks) as Fashion Symbols\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"In Asia, it’s been the norm to wear masks for a long time.

The question I keep asking is why are CloudKitchens coming to prominence but CloudGrocers are not? To borrow from my other post, the closest example of this idea is GoodEggs. GoodEggs has no physical storefronts and has an inventory of high-quality, organic, etc. products that you can have delivered to your home the same day. While they seem to be the only real player in this market, their products are<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh/status/1247588324476256256?s=20\"> too expensive</a> and do not appeal to a mainstream audience. What I imagine is possible is that existing chains like Safeway (or a startup) could buy up cheap warehouse space, stock inventory Costco-style, and then allow people to place orders online. Over time, they could augment with robotics to make the packaging of items seamless and inexpensive. It seems like what GoodEggs doesn’t have is their own inventory though. I imagine a startup that creates its own private label products (e.g, Safeway’s “Signature Select” or Whole Foods “365 Everyday Value”) and supplements with other manufacturer brands so that they own the whole value chain. They could either start doing delivery via Instacart or have delivery be a key part of their own company from the start. I have to imagine that in many cases, consumers don’t actually care whether they are buying private labels or Clorox. Consumers want the highest quality at the lowest cost. A ‘CloudGrocer’ could be uniquely positioned to deliver this.</p><h3 id=\"new-tools-for-online-shopping\">New Tools for Online Shopping</h3><p>A lot of shopping has already moved online and in the same vein as the last two bullets, I expect to see more and more adoption of online shopping of all kinds across new demographics.

In China, e-commerce grocery shopping benefitted the most and net new adds to Chinese mobile e-commerce spiked the most for people 30+ in tier 3 and tier 4 cities.

Right now, I suspended my gym membership, but given 1-2 more months of working out from home, I might not feel the need to resume my membership post-COVID. The rise of at-home fitness hardware will also make this transition easier for a lot of people. Besides expensive hardware providers like Peloton and Tonal, there are also less expensive options like doorframe pull bars, exercise balls, and kettlebells. For fitness studios, I could see a decrease in gym memberships going either way. For example, because I am no longer paying for a gym membership, I might be more open to paying for a monthly yoga membership or paying money to pick up a new physical hobby (e.g., Archery lessons), but still TBD.</p><h3 id=\"health-and-masks-as-fashion-symbols\">Health (and masks) as Fashion Symbols</h3><p>In Asia, it’s been the norm to wear masks for a long time.

I’ve said to friends that there is a fine line between OpenDoor and WeWork, where OpenDoor is a tech company that tries to do things in the physical world and WeWork is a physical company that tries to be a tech company. Possibly due to the success of companies like Uber, scooter companies, etc. VCs have been keen to fund companies that dance on this line, but seeing as these companies are getting crushed the most in this COVID downturn, we may see VCs back away from companies going after these kinds of problems.</p><p>Extra credit: Ben Thompson’s ‘<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fstratechery.com%2F2019%2Fwhat-is-a-tech-company%2F&amp;t=MGZlNTNjYTBjODliMjVhODQxNTRjYmE3NWQxZTEyNjVmYTNjYTgwYSxFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&amp;m=1\">What is a Tech Company</a>’ describes this better than I could hope to.</p><h3 id=\"new-types-of-online-learning\">New types of Online Learning</h3><p>There has been a lot of talk about remote learning from a few different angles, but one that I find most interesting are companies focused on learning for practical skills (cooking, fitness, woodworking, pottery) that you pay for possibly on a monthly basis.

I wrote more about portable benefits in my post on the<a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1FOgbY0_9S7i5P7JbiRT-NoNEk3Bn4JWmK-8Ld_1r-Pg%2Fedit%23heading%3Dh.ico4hfeyl110&amp;t=OTQ3YzQyMmMxYWQ3YzA3NTRjYTIzOTI4YTI0M2JlZmNmZTk0NGI5NixFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&amp;m=1\"> future of work </a>(section 2.1). At the highest level, portable benefits allow 1099 workers, who may have multiple streams of income and no full-time employer to easily manage and contribute to their healthcare-related benefits. The idea here is that many people are working multiple contractor jobs that provide multiple income streams, but no fringe benefits and easy way to manage their benefits. Companies like Etsy have <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fextfiles.etsy.com%2Fadvocacy%2FEtsy_EconomicSecurity_2016.pdf&amp;t=YTgzZDgwMzcwYmU0YzViYjI0ZTE5OTNjMDhjODdkYTU5YWY4NzQ1MixFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&amp;m=1\">proposed ideas</a> such as enabling tax withholding for 1099 employees, streamlining flexible spending accounts, or creating a “Federal Benefits Portal, which would tie all benefits (retirement, health insurance, paid leave, tax-advantaged savings accounts, disability, etc.) to the individual, providing a single marketplace to view, choose and pay for their benefits, regardless of where or how they earn income. Companies like <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.catch.co%2F&amp;t=NjFiYTQ4ZTcxZDczOWY0ZTFhMjNmYTlkZGI0MzZhNDc4OTIyNjA0NCxFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&amp;m=1\">Catch Benefits</a> are working on this now and I expect to see them continue to grow or for additional players to pop up in this space. What I would be really impressed with would be seeing an association of companies with the largest gig workforces (Uber, Lyft, Instacart, Amazon, Etsy, etc. etc.) getting together to come up with an agreed-upon standard and then propose legislation for being able to also contribute directly to their workers’ portable benefits accounts.</p><h2 id=\"remote-work-\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Remote Work:</strong></strong></strong></strong></h2><h3 id=\"tighter-spending-practices-accelerating-remote-work\">Tighter Spending Practices Accelerating Remote Work</h3><p>Moving forward, a lot of companies will have much tighter rein on their spending.

If a company allows employees to work from less expensive geographies, it can become a competitive differentiator in the hiring process. This opens up the potential to hire experienced candidates who live in cheaper geographies because they want to raise a family, own a home, and save most of their income.</li></ol><h3 id=\"reset-of-commercial-and-residential-real-estate-prices\">Reset of Commercial and Residential Real Estate Prices</h3><p>In geographies like San Francisco, some other impacts that could have are a reset of commercial and residential real estate prices, making the Bay Area more affordable for the people and companies that do choose to stay in the area.

Some second-order effects invoked that I had not given consideration to are: 1) In a factory/warehouse environment where workers are subjected to dangerous work conditions are/or regularly lift heavy objects, the worker compensation costs are significant with humans, and are obviously 0 with machines. I am sure there are a number of other fringe benefits that robots eliminate. Also, if you’ve seen the Amazon machines moving through factories, their slim size can allow for smaller aisles and, in turn, better overall facility utilization.</p><h3 id=\"people-will-save-more-money\">People will Save more Money</h3><p>Thanks to how my parents raised me, I am extremely cost-conscious and a big saver. Unfortunately, I notice many of my millennial peers like to spend basically all of the money they make. I predict that the shock that COVID sent through the system will turn saving into a more ubiquitous habit as people are now more conscious of downturns and layoffs. Saving money, investing money, and earmarking money for something other than short-term spending is a good habit that benefits people long-term. Apps like Acorns, Wealthfront, etc. that encourage savings and earmarking funds for e.g., trips will benefit from this change. My friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Crubenfeld\">Charles Rubenfeld</a> points out that interest rates could be zero for a very long time. This raises an interesting point of where people go to save money? This could lead to an inflow of dollars into passive and active investment strategies. It’s also a good argument for some of the crypto applications like <a href=\"https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dharma.io%2F&amp;t=ZmJkZDI5NDkyN2U0N2VmZDZhMWRkYmY3NWVmNmMwNTIzMmQzYWRiMixFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&amp;m=1\">Dharma</a> that offer high (2-6%) interest rates in a “savings” account that takes advantage of crypto-lending on the backend.

The question I keep\nasking is why are CloudKitchens coming to prominence but CloudGrocers are not?\nTo borrow from my other post, the closest example of this idea is GoodEggs.\nGoodEggs has no physical storefronts and has an inventory of high-quality,\norganic, etc. products that you can have delivered to your home the same day.\nWhile they seem to be the only real player in this market, their products are \ntoo expensive\n[https://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh/status/1247588324476256256?s=20] and do not\nappeal to a mainstream audience. What I imagine is possible is that existing\nchains like Safeway (or a startup) could buy up cheap warehouse space, stock\ninventory Costco-style, and then allow people to place orders online. Over time,\nthey could augment with robotics to make the packaging of items seamless and\ninexpensive. It seems like what GoodEggs doesn’t have is their own inventory\nthough. I imagine a startup that creates its own private label products (e.g,\nSafeway’s “Signature Select” or Whole Foods “365 Everyday Value”) and\nsupplements with other manufacturer brands so that they own the whole value\nchain. They could either start doing delivery via Instacart or have delivery be\na key part of their own company from the start. I have to imagine that in many\ncases, consumers don’t actually care whether they are buying private labels or\nClorox. Consumers want the highest quality at the lowest cost.

For long-time gym\ngoers like myself, I am finding it surprisingly efficient to workout at home.\nWith the exception of a squat rack/straight bar, I can do everything I would\nhave done in a gym from the comfort of home. Right now, I suspended my gym\nmembership, but given 1-2 more months of working out from home, I might not feel\nthe need to resume my membership post-COVID. The rise of at-home fitness\nhardware will also make this transition easier for a lot of people. Besides\nexpensive hardware providers like Peloton and Tonal, there are also less\nexpensive options like doorframe pull bars, exercise balls, and kettlebells. For\nfitness studios, I could see a decrease in gym memberships going either way. For\nexample, because I am no longer paying for a gym membership, I might be more\nopen to paying for a monthly yoga membership or paying money to pick up a new\nphysical hobby (e.g., Archery lessons), but still TBD.\n\nHealth (and masks) as Fashion Symbols\nIn Asia, it’s been the norm to wear masks for a long time. I believe this has\nlargely been due to poor air quality. When I was living in Asia, I always\nappreciated how fashionable people looked in masks. I am excited to see how\nmajor brands can speed up this transition to mask-wearing becoming a norm in\nthe\nUS [https://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh/status/1243953941756313600?s=20]. I\nexpect brands like Adidas/Yeezy or Nike to manufacture stylish, branded masks.\nYou could own them in multiple colors to match your outfit for the day.

This could even tie in with a personal\nhealth certificate / electronic medical record application on your phone or\napple watch that can be scanned for “proof-of-health”.\n\nRenaissance of Cooking\nI’ve discovered a new love of cooking during this quarantine. Most groups I am a\npart of have added channels for “quarantine cooking” where people can share\ntheir latest creations. From what I can see on Twitter of people making\nsourdough bread, it seems like a lot of people are enjoying cooking, possibly\nfor the first time in a while. This could be a win for DTC companies that make\nhigh-quality ingredients. Companies like Kettle and Fire\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kettleandfire.com%2F&t=N2NjOGU4MDIyYzAwZGQ3OWJiYzRlYWVkYjMyMGUyZWE1MDU2MzJiOCxFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1] \nand Anthony’s Goods\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthonysgoods.com%2F&t=NjQzZmMxMmEyYmI4MDVjNWVjZDM4YWE5NDhiMDVkYzZlNTRjNTE4ZixFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1] \ncome to mind. I think this will spur a lot more opportunities for YouTubers and\ncooking websites to monetize as people are turning to the web to figure out how\nto cook new recipes. My friend Steve again points out that this could also be a\nwin for live streaming likes like “Twitch and IG Live. Group cooking is very\nsocial and much lower barrier to entry since people are cooking and streaming\nthemselves much more”\n\nGeneration Germaphobe\nDuring COVID, I have found myself becoming extremely conscious of everything\nthat I touch. I think it will be tough to rid myself of his consciousness. I can\nsee a whole generation of people turning into permanent germaphobes. This could\nlong-term be good for hand sanitizer and long-term bad for public places like\ngyms (as I touched on above). Steve points out that this could also manifest in\nsome unexpected domains like dating, “The AIDS epidemic caused people to start\npracticing safe sex much more frequently and asking a partner about their\nhistory. That wasn’t done before.”\n\nStartups:\nDigital Spaces Replace More Physical Spaces\nI saw a stat that OnlyFans\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fonlyfans.com%2F&t=YWVlODIzNDIzODMxMGZhMjFlNTAwMTk1NmRmNmNkZmIyYTIwZGNjZixFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1] \nnew registrations have spiked during COVID. \n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fcameronwilson%2Fcoronavirus-streaming-youtube-twitch-onlyfans&t=MDUyMjE1YmIyYmU2OGU1MzhlMGRhYmE4NGIyNmUwZmIyNjJmNDczMyxFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1]\nCan websites like OnlyFans continue to grow and become ’the digital strip club’\npost-COVID?

Between March\n6 and 17, there was a 75% increase in people signing up.” I’ve read the same is\ntrue for Patreon, YouTube, and Twitch. According to Wikipedia, \"As of February\n2020, [OnlyFans] [already] has 20 million registered users and claims to have\npaid out $400 million to its 200,000 content creators.” Given that OnlyFans\nsplits rev 80% content creator / 20% only fans, this stat implies OnlyFans has\nmade 100M in revenue in its 4 year existence. The OnlyFans take rate is notably\nmore than Patreon (5-8%) and lower than YouTube ads fee (45%).\n\nWhile I was writing this post, I came across an article in the NYT titled “\nInside the Strip Clubs of Instagram\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2Fstyle%2Fjustin-laboy-instagram-strip-clubs-live.html&t=ZjZhNTliNDM5N2U4MjMzMTFjMDYwZTg3YzkwYmYzY2E2NDQ2Yzk0MSxFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1]\n”.\n\nNew Social Experiences\nAs people crave more social interaction, potentially long-term if remote work\ntruly picks up, people will seek to create new social experiences from actions\nthat previously weren’t social.

They could add options like “Keto” or “Vegan” so you could curate your\nfeed to your own dietary preferences.

Video Games like Fortnite and Roblox\nhave done a lot to create one new type of social experience, but there are still\nmany untapped frontiers.\n\nLess Funding Towards Companies focused on the Physical World\nOne trend I have noticed in venture funding is a lot of money going towards\ncompanies operating in the physical world. I use companies like Uber and\nOpenDoor as examples of companies that are clearly technology companies, but\nthat have a large physical presence. I’ve said to friends that there is a fine\nline between OpenDoor and WeWork, where OpenDoor is a tech company that tries to\ndo things in the physical world and WeWork is a physical company that tries to\nbe a tech company. Possibly due to the success of companies like Uber, scooter\ncompanies, etc. VCs have been keen to fund companies that dance on this line,\nbut seeing as these companies are getting crushed the most in this COVID\ndownturn, we may see VCs back away from companies going after these kinds of\nproblems.\n\nExtra credit: Ben Thompson’s ‘What is a Tech Company\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fstratechery.com%2F2019%2Fwhat-is-a-tech-company%2F&t=MGZlNTNjYTBjODliMjVhODQxNTRjYmE3NWQxZTEyNjVmYTNjYTgwYSxFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1]\n’ describes this better than I could hope to.\n\nNew types of Online Learning\nThere has been a lot of talk about remote learning from a few different angles,\nbut one that I find most interesting are companies focused on learning for\npractical skills (cooking, fitness, woodworking, pottery) that you pay for\npossibly on a monthly basis. Similar to wikihow, but where the video creators\ntake home a large chunk of the revenue for the videos they create. An overly\nsimplistic framework for a company doing this:\n\n 1. Total monthly rev for the company is $1M\n 2. January has 10M total views across all videos\n 3. Ryan creates an archery tutorial that drives 1M views in a month (10% of\n    total views)\n 4. Ryan makes 1M * 10% * 80% = $80,000 for the month of January\n\nI recently came across Jumprope\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jumprope.com%2F&t=MjZlYzQ1OTllNjg0OWFhZTQ4ZGMzNGNkMDg3NGFiY2Q1ODk1OGU1MyxFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1]\n, a company that makes it easier for creators to create ‘how-to’ videos.\n\nJen Yip [https://twitter.com/nifferkin] makes the great point that there is a\nhuge difference between watching a how-to video and thinking you understand\ndoing something and then trying it and realizing how tough it is. A company that\ncould bridge this gap by e.g,. Merging online instruction + real world practice\n(in the form of studios or take home kits) would be really interesting.\n\nPortable Benefits\nSince 2017 when I started following some of the 2nd order impacts of the gig\neconomy, I began to recognize the importance of portable benefits for 1099\nworkers. I wrote more about portable benefits in my post on the future of work\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1FOgbY0_9S7i5P7JbiRT-NoNEk3Bn4JWmK-8Ld_1r-Pg%2Fedit%23heading%3Dh.ico4hfeyl110&t=OTQ3YzQyMmMxYWQ3YzA3NTRjYTIzOTI4YTI0M2JlZmNmZTk0NGI5NixFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1]\n(section 2.1). At the highest level, portable benefits allow 1099 workers, who\nmay have multiple streams of income and no full-time employer to easily manage\nand contribute to their healthcare-related benefits. The idea here is that many\npeople are working multiple contractor jobs that provide multiple income\nstreams, but no fringe benefits and easy way to manage their benefits. Companies\nlike Etsy have proposed ideas\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fextfiles.etsy.com%2Fadvocacy%2FEtsy_EconomicSecurity_2016.pdf&t=YTgzZDgwMzcwYmU0YzViYjI0ZTE5OTNjMDhjODdkYTU5YWY4NzQ1MixFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1] \nsuch as enabling tax withholding for 1099 employees, streamlining flexible\nspending accounts, or creating a “Federal Benefits Portal, which would tie all\nbenefits (retirement, health insurance, paid leave, tax-advantaged savings\naccounts, disability, etc.) to the individual, providing a single marketplace to\nview, choose and pay for their benefits, regardless of where or how they earn\nincome. Companies like Catch Benefits\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.catch.co%2F&t=NjFiYTQ4ZTcxZDczOWY0ZTFhMjNmYTlkZGI0MzZhNDc4OTIyNjA0NCxFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1] \nare working on this now and I expect to see them continue to grow or for\nadditional players to pop up in this space. What I would be really impressed\nwith would be seeing an association of companies with the largest gig workforces\n(Uber, Lyft, Instacart, Amazon, Etsy, etc. etc.) getting together to come up\nwith an agreed-upon standard and then propose legislation for being able to also\ncontribute directly to their workers’ portable benefits accounts.\n\nRemote Work:\nTighter Spending Practices Accelerating Remote Work\nMoving forward, a lot of companies will have much tighter rein on their\nspending. This could mean hiring CFO/VP Finance much earlier for many companies.\nOr it could mean a boom for outsourced tech/human in the loop firms.\n\nCompanies are realizing (1) they have a lot of headcount they did not need (2)\nthey pay a lot of money for talent and office space in SF/NYC/Boston/Seattle/LA.\n\nThis, in combination with companies realizing how effective their workforce can\nbe when remote could be the push that remote work needs to become the default\nfor a lot of companies. There are many downstream impacts of remote work\nbecoming the norm.\n\n 1. Hire/Retain Talent: Competition for software engineers in the Bay Area is\n    competitive and shows no signs of cooling off. This makes it harder to get\n    candidates in the door and raises salaries. Even when you make a great hire,\n    “San Francisco [has] the shortest average job tenure\n    [https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.indeed.com%2F2017%2F04%2F03%2Fsilicon-valley-tech-job-migration%2F&t=ZTcxZTYzMjAwNWYxOGZlZDRiNTYxNGQwNGE3ZmQyNWExYTIyMTkzMSxFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1] \n    of any metro, and [is] well below the national average”. High turnover winds\n    up costing companies a lot in the form of retraining, lost productivity, and\n    decreases in morale that comes with turnover (especially for small\n    companies).\n 2. Save Money: Besides high salaries, Silicon Valley also has some of the\n    country’s highest office space prices, health care costs, corporate taxes,\n    food prices, utility costs, and transportation costs.\n 3. Higher Quality of Life: Residents in the Bay Area also have higher taxes and\n    general cost of living expenses (gas, food, etc.) than virtually anywhere\n    else in America. If a company allows employees to work from less expensive\n    geographies, it can become a competitive differentiator in the hiring\n    process. This opens up the potential to hire experienced candidates who live\n    in cheaper geographies because they want to raise a family, own a home, and\n    save most of their income.\n\nReset of Commercial and Residential Real Estate Prices\nIn geographies like San Francisco, some other impacts that could have are a\nreset of commercial and residential real estate prices, making the Bay Area more\naffordable for the people and companies that do choose to stay in the area.\nUnfortunately, small businesses will likely be going out of business at alarming\nrates, this means even more commercial real estate opening up. As Steve points\nout, this could be a massive reallocation of CRE towards CloudKitchens,\nCloudXYZ, accelerating the trend toward a retail apocalypse.\n\nOther Trends\nIncrease pace of Automation\nMany manufacturing facilities that rely on large in-person staff are facing a\nlot of difficulties right now. While there may be skyrocketing demand for their\nproducts, they are stuck between keeping manufacturing running while also\nkeeping their personnel healthy. I predict that post-COVID, many facilities will\ninvest more in automation to prevent personnel issues in the future. In the\nfirst section of an older post\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1FOgbY0_9S7i5P7JbiRT-NoNEk3Bn4JWmK-8Ld_1r-Pg%2Fedit%23&t=ZWVkYzBmYTk5ZGM5NzQ0Nzc3NjQ0ZjZhMDE2YjQ5M2FkNmM4OWNhYyxFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1] \nI highlight data from Ark Invest\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fark-invest.com%2Fresearch%2Findustrial-robot-costs&t=NzVlYzYxOGNiNGM5MjljMTMzYzAwMWI4YmUzMjIxZWYyZDYxOWExNSxFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1] \nthat states, as the cost to manufacture robots has come, demand has steadily\nincreased, and projections for future sales of industrial robots are steady\nacross most, if not all, forecasts. This trend is already in motion, but I\nexpect to see it sped up as companies want to preserve their resilience and\ndecrease dependence on people in the future.\n\nTangent: In an older, unpublished post, I highlighted some of the other reasons\nwhy companies should invest in automation:\n\n\"In the warehouse environment, for example, one insurance professional said that\nin terms of cost and efficiency robots always beat humans (uh, duh). Some\nsecond-order effects invoked that I had not given consideration to are: 1) In a\nfactory/warehouse environment where workers are subjected to dangerous work\nconditions are/or regularly lift heavy objects, the worker compensation costs\nare significant with humans, and are obviously 0 with machines. I am sure there\nare a number of other fringe benefits that robots eliminate. Also, if you’ve\nseen the Amazon machines moving through factories, their slim size can allow for\nsmaller aisles and, in turn, better overall facility utilization.\n\nPeople will Save more Money\nThanks to how my parents raised me, I am extremely cost-conscious and a big\nsaver. Unfortunately, I notice many of my millennial peers like to spend\nbasically all of the money they make. I predict that the shock that COVID sent\nthrough the system will turn saving into a more ubiquitous habit as people are\nnow more conscious of downturns and layoffs. Saving money, investing money, and\nearmarking money for something other than short-term spending is a good habit\nthat benefits people long-term. Apps like Acorns, Wealthfront, etc. that\nencourage savings and earmarking funds for e.g., trips will benefit from this\nchange. My friend Charles Rubenfeld [https://twitter.com/Crubenfeld] points out\nthat interest rates could be zero for a very long time. This raises an\ninteresting point of where people go to save money? This could lead to an inflow\nof dollars into passive and active investment strategies. It’s also a good\nargument for some of the crypto applications like Dharma\n[https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dharma.io%2F&t=ZmJkZDI5NDkyN2U0N2VmZDZhMWRkYmY3NWVmNmMwNTIzMmQzYWRiMixFOEtEZHp2WQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AokV1QflKCp7Agf216l_L8Q&p=https%3A%2F%2Fryanrodenbaugh.com%2Fpost%2F616683225778208768%2Fpost-covid19-predictions&m=1] \nthat offer high (2-6%) interest rates in a “savings” account that takes\nadvantage of crypto-lending on the backend. While the risk profile of an app\nlike this isn’t == to a Wells Fargo savings account, it provides a consistent\nreturn on cash holdings.\n\n2020 Presidential Election:\nIt’s easy to forget that this is a Presidential election year. I can’t see the\ndemocratic and republican national conventions taking place in person this\nAugust. A couple questions: which candidate benefits more? If Trump continues to\ndominate tv screens and Biden gets no coverage, it could benefit Trump. If Trump\nbotches COVID, it could benefit Biden, etc.\n\nAs far as a quick search could tell me, US presidential elections have never\nbefore been delayed and there isn’t a process for trying to delay them.\n\nIf elections do take place, you know the results will be extremely contested.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579781354147-e863d998e97f?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-10T22:00:50.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-20T04:27:19.000Z","published_at":"2020-04-28T22:01:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f0a08b8f5da790039530046","uuid":"25db4e9f-10c7-4593-87ce-9ccc4ebe866e","title":"Gojek:

He then spent 3 years at McKinsey in Indonesia before doing his MBA at Harvard Business School. After Harvard, he returned to Indonesia and while founding Gojek (the call center, not the super app), also <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadiemmakarim/\">spent time</a> as the co-founder of Zalora’s Indonesian branch (a Rocket Internet e-commerce company) and as “Chief Innovation Officer” of Kartuku, a company that ironically Gojek would later acquire in 2017.</p><p>He came up with the idea for Gojek while at HBS, reflecting on his childhood in Indonesia and how inefficient the ojek market was in Indonesia.</p><h2 id=\"amount-raised\"><strong><strong><strong>Amount raised</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Gojek has raised <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/go-jek/funding_financials\">$4.5 billion+ across 10 rounds</a> of funding.

Since then, Gojek raised funds from a who’s who of investors including private equity firms, KKR and Warburg Pincus, along with many corporate investors including Google, JD, Tencent, and most recently Facebook and PayPal.</p><h2 id=\"the-history-of-gojek\"><strong><strong><strong>The History of Gojek</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>The company was founded in 2010 as a call center in Jakarta so that customers could order <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_taxi#Indonesia\">ojeks</a> (motorcycle taxis) by phone. Similar to Uber and Lyft, Gojek wanted to make it easier to find a driver and eliminate haggling around pricing.</p><p>Wikipedia points out on ojeks that,</p><blockquote>“Many ojek drivers either own their vehicles or are buying them on credit, although in some areas, stolen motorcycles are common. The widespread availability of cheap, domestic motorcycles made by Honda, Yamaha, and Suzuki, and even cheaper ones imported from China, as well as credit schemes with which to purchase these, have resulted in the rapid growth of ojek. The ease with which driver's licenses can be obtained has also been a contributing factor.”</blockquote><p>It appears that between the founding of Gojek in 2010 and 2014, no outside capital was raised.</p><p>By 2014, the call-center was handling about 200 drivers and was mostly a manual matching process between riders and drivers. At this point, Gojek raised money from a few investors, including Sequoia Capital.</p><p>When the app launched in 2015, Gojek had drawn inspiration from Uber and Lyft, but made the deliberate effort to launch with more than <em>just</em> ridesharing. My sense of what was going on in the background was that Gojek’s main competitor in Southeast Asia, Grab (which I’ll cover in my next issue), launched in 2012 in Malaysia and by 2014, was beginning to expand ridesharing into Indonesia. Gojek could not afford to lose their home market and wanted to give users multiple reasons to use their app so they launched with several applications for users whereas, at this point, Grab was only ridesharing. Nadiem did not believe ridesharing alone could create a strong enough network effect for the business so Gojek launched its app with motorbike ridesharing, delivery (Go-Food), and shopping (Go-Send).</p><p>By late 2015, Gojek was managing more than <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-go-jek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-2-35f6a27a0faf\">300,000 orders</a> every day.</p><p>In the first 14 months of the app being live, they had 100M+ transactions across all the offerings.</p><p>They quickly launched additional services including Go-Mart (grocery delivery), Go-Clean (a housekeeping and cleaning service), and Go-Massage (for booking spa treatments anywhere).</p><p>By its $550M funding in 2016, the app had been downloaded more than <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-04/go-jek-said-to-raise-over-550-million-in-kkr-warburg-led-round\">20 million times</a> (corresponding to about ~7% of the Indonesian population).</p><p>In 2017 they made a push into financial services and launched a mobile wallet (Go-Pay) that was viewed as a play to bank Indonesia’s largely unbanked population. They made a string of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/15/uber-rival-go-jek-acquires-three-fintech-startups-in-payments-push.html\">acquisitions</a> (“offline payments service <em>Kartuku</em>, payment gateway <em>Midtrans</em> and saving and lending firm <em>Mapan</em>”) to get them closer to that ambition.</p><p>By 2018, the app had <a href=\"https://medium.com/life-at-go-jek/gojeks-growth-story-the-secret-behind-our-hypergrowth-a069a97cfde4\">125 million+ downloads</a> and was doing about <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-go-jek-manages-1-million-drivers-with-12-engineers-part-2-35f6a27a0faf\">1.1 billion orders </a>per year across all of their offerings.</p><p>In May of 2018, Gojek <a href=\"https://www.gojek.com/blog/gojek/go-jek-to-launch-international-expansion-into-four-new-markets/\">announced</a> their intentions to commit $500 million towards its expansion plans across Southeast Asia.

In the early days of Gojek, users paid their drivers with cash. There were no alternatives.</p><p>Now, Gojek has a WIDE range of financial service offerings. Long-term when I think about Gojek, they’re much more interesting as a financial services company than as a ride-hailing service.</p><p>The core product underlying all of Gojek’s payment offerings is their mobile wallet GoPay, which was introduced in 2015. Like most of Southeast Asia, Indonesia’s population is largely unbanked. One of the onramps for GoPay was that users could top-up their accounts via Gojek drivers. Users could give cash to a Gojek driver who would credit that to their account. Given the ubiquity of their drivers, Gojek became a branchless-bank with their drivers acting as bank branches.</p><p>At first, GoPay was just a way to pay for Gojek services, but <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/11/13/indonesias-go-jek-sees-go-pay-spun-off-from-main-app-in-2018.html\">as of 2018</a>, it began to act as an online and offline digital wallet that consumers could use for Gojek services, non-Gojek online commerce, and offline commerce.</p><p>Per a March 2019 Gojek <a href=\"https://medium.com/life-at-go-jek/shaping-the-future-of-payment-with-gojek-f6552a3c828\">blog post</a>, “GO-PAY accounts for some 30 percent of the total electronic money transactions in Indonesia.” Another <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/what-is-a-super-app-4f2d889451e6\">post</a> shares that, “GO-PAY is accepted at close to 300,000 online and offline merchants in Indonesia, and processes $6.3 billion of annualized Gross Transaction Value (GTV)”</p><p>In addition to GoPay, the company has financial offerings including:</p><ul><li>GoPulsa - to top up mobile minutes for pre-paid phone plans</li><li>GoBills - to pay bills ranging from everything from utilities to private schools</li><li>GoPoints - similar to credit card reward points you can earn from using GoPay</li><li>GoInvestAsi - to buy and sell gold <em>(when BTC?)</em></li><li>GoPayLater - a credit-like feature where you can pay off your bill at the end of the month</li><li>GoSure - offers life, cracked screen, motorbike, travel, disaster, ticket cancellation, and medical insurance</li></ul><p>I cut a lot of text from this section, but if you’d like to read 3,000 words going <strong>really</strong> in-depth on each of Gojek’s product offerings, you can find the text that I cut from this post <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmkrfLRqzfHNDBGx_ywDifPAGIEU5H-GgHK3yHz6HgM/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.</p><p><em>(Note from Ryan: I am still working on finding the balance of writing thorough yet to-the-point overviews.

Their goal was to turn Gojek into the operating system of the phone. WeChat enjoys this luxury in China and Gojek wanted the same relationship with Indonesians and other Southeast Asian citizens. As I mentioned earlier, Gojek, in my estimation, seems to have relied more on developing services in-house than other SuperApps and this was their chance to begin branching out.</p><p>The first product they rolled out with the TPP was Gonews (covered <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/breaking-now-go-news-and-the-quest-for-engagement-f9ed65613679\">here</a>).

I imagine this is something that will become more ‘open’ over time. I also understand why in the early days, they want to keep the ecosystem closed (and quality very high).</p><h2 id=\"competitors-\"><strong><strong><strong>Competitors:</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>In the race for Super App domination of SEA, Grab is Gojek’s biggest competitor. Uber was in the race until it sold its Southeast Asia operations to Grab.</p><p>Ironically,  Gojek’s co-founder and previous CEO and Grab’s co-founder/CEO both attended Harvard Business School at the same time and were friends.

The fact that Grab acquired Uber’s Southeast Asia operations strengthens that comparison.</p><p>Gojek has more services than Grab, but Gojek has not done well to expand outside of their home market, and there’s some debate that they’re no longer even the dominant player in Indonesia. ABI Research <a href=\"https://theinsiderstories.com/grab-leads-11-4-ride-hailing-in-asia-pacific-abi-research-finds/\">says</a> that Grab has 60%+ market share in Indonesia, a figure which Gojek <a href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/grab-gojek-super-apps/#:~:text=Even%20in%20Indonesia%20itself%2C%20Grab,Go%2DJek%20disputes%20that%20figure.\">disputes</a>.</p><h2 id=\"international-expansion\"><strong><strong><strong>International Expansion</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>In 2017, Gojek’s internal teams, led by their COO decided it was time for the company to begin expanding <a href=\"https://blog.gojekengineering.com/to-new-frontiers-how-gojek-went-international-f2fd632f60fc\">beyond</a> Indonesia (3 years after Grab began international expansion). Gojek looked for markets with similar characteristics as Indonesia (growing mobile penetration, no food delivery market, and no dominant digital wallet).</p><p>In May of 2018, Gojek <a href=\"https://www.gojek.com/blog/gojek/go-jek-to-launch-international-expansion-into-four-new-markets/\">announced</a> their intentions to commit $500M towards expansion plans across Southeast Asia, specifically Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines. This was announced just two months after Grab acquired Uber’s SEA operations which gave Grab Uber’s operations in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p><p>The plan for Gojek was to begin with ridesharing in Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines, and then offer those new users other Gojek Super App features. They planned to hire and work with local management teams to lead each of these initiatives.</p><p>Besides just having local teams, each of these new markets would have unique branding (Vietnam: Go-VIET, Thailand: GET, etc.).</p><p>As of November 2019, it <a href=\"https://jakartaglobe.id/business/gointernational-gojek-seeks-more-southeast-asian-expansion\">seems</a> Gojek’s user breakdown was still 80% Indonesia / 20% international, though they hope to get to 50/50 in the next 5 years.</p><p><em>Side note: I visited Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines in 2019 and I used Grab in all of these countries.

In December of 2015, Ingasius Jonan, the transportation minister of Indonesia, was rebuked by the President for attempting to ban the use of personal vehicles by Gojek drivers. This was seen as an effort to defend the taxi industry. In response, Nadiem <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-transportation/indonesian-president-rebukes-minister-over-ride-hailing-crackdown-idUSKBN0U10CF20151218\">tweeted</a>, “Thanks to President @Jokowi for his support to 200 thousand Go-Jek drivers and 8-million of our application users,”</p><p>Then, 7 months later in July of 2016, Indonesia’s President removed Ignasius from his role as transportation minister.</p><p>In their marketing language, Gojek (and Go-VIET and GET) make strong nationalist appeals that likely go a long way with government officials. The jackets for each country’s drivers are the color of their flag and have their national flags embroidered.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb4e26be-4fb7-4eb0-b133-2b45dccb2067_173x184.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>^Vietnam</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70f98f6c-65a5-4674-a9cb-5ea1cf66c11f_176x228.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>^Indonesia</p><p>On the page for <a href=\"https://www.gojek.com/gofood/\">GoFood</a>, it says, <em>“Do you realize that your order improves the Indonesian economy as well as the Indonesian society?

This is done to make governance easier for the central authority.</p><p>Gojek embodies the opposite of this in the best way possible.

Imagine if every time you opened your phone instead of deciding whether to click on iMessage, Uber, Doordash, Apple News, Chase, YouTube, Netflix, and Booking.com, you only had to click on one app, Gojek, and then within Gojek, you had their “Go” equivalent of all the above choices.

If WhatsApp roles out mini-programs <em>(Mini-programs are little downloadable apps that run inside another larger app. I’ll cover this in my WeChat issue.) </em>and Gojek has an exclusive agreement (aka, no Grab allowed) to build out their product on top of this, it could help to cement their winning position in Indonesia.</p><p>It’s worth noting that all PR comments and the FB newsroom <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/gojek-investment-indonesia-small-businesses/\">post</a> announcing the investment all came from WhatsApp, specifically COO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-idema-20a119/\">Matt Idema</a>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Gojek rolled out GoChat in April 2019. It’s possible that that feature is seeing little usage because of WhatsApp’s existing dominance so maybe they decide to kill Gochat, build a Gojek “mini-program” on top of WhatsApp, and ‘The Facebook Company’ decided to not compete with Gojek on payments in Indonesia.</p><p>Time will tell…</p><h2 id=\"exit-\"><strong><strong><strong>Exit:</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Given how much money Gojek has raised, it seems like the most likely path they have to an exit is an IPO.

He then spent 3 years at McKinsey in Indonesia before doing his MBA\nat Harvard Business School. After Harvard, he returned to Indonesia and while\nfounding Gojek (the call center, not the super app), also spent time\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadiemmakarim/] as the co-founder of Zalora’s\nIndonesian branch (a Rocket Internet e-commerce company) and as “Chief\nInnovation Officer” of Kartuku, a company that ironically Gojek would later\nacquire in 2017.\n\nHe came up with the idea for Gojek while at HBS, reflecting on his childhood in\nIndonesia and how inefficient the ojek market was in Indonesia.\n\nAmount raised\nGojek has raised $4.5 billion+ across 10 rounds\n[https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/go-jek/funding_financials] of funding.\nThe company’s first round was raised by Singaporean-based VCs Openspace Ventures\nand Capikris Foundation, with its next round led by Sequoia Capital and DST\nGlobal. Since then, Gojek raised funds from a who’s who of investors including\nprivate equity firms, KKR and Warburg Pincus, along with many corporate\ninvestors including Google, JD, Tencent, and most recently Facebook and PayPal.\n\nThe History of Gojek\nThe company was founded in 2010 as a call center in Jakarta so that customers\ncould order ojeks [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_taxi#Indonesia] \n(motorcycle taxis) by phone. Similar to Uber and Lyft, Gojek wanted to make it\neasier to find a driver and eliminate haggling around pricing.\n\nWikipedia points out on ojeks that,\n\n> “Many ojek drivers either own their vehicles or are buying them on credit,\nalthough in some areas, stolen motorcycles are common. The widespread\navailability of cheap, domestic motorcycles made by Honda, Yamaha, and Suzuki,\nand even cheaper ones imported from China, as well as credit schemes with which\nto purchase these, have resulted in the rapid growth of ojek. The ease with\nwhich driver's licenses can be obtained has also been a contributing factor.”\nIt appears that between the founding of Gojek in 2010 and 2014, no outside\ncapital was raised.\n\nBy 2014, the call-center was handling about 200 drivers and was mostly a manual\nmatching process between riders and drivers. At this point, Gojek raised money\nfrom a few investors, including Sequoia Capital.\n\nWhen the app launched in 2015, Gojek had drawn inspiration from Uber and Lyft,\nbut made the deliberate effort to launch with more than just ridesharing. My\nsense of what was going on in the background was that Gojek’s main competitor in\nSoutheast Asia, Grab (which I’ll cover in my next issue), launched in 2012 in\nMalaysia and by 2014, was beginning to expand ridesharing into Indonesia.

The plan was, to begin with, ridesharing in Vietnam, Thailand,\nSingapore, and the Philippines, and then offer those users other Gojek Super App\nfeatures. They planned to hire and work with local management teams to lead each\nof these initiatives. I will touch on the progress and strategy for\ninternational expansion later on.\n\nAs of October 2019, the company claimed\n[https://www.gojek.com/blog/gojek/co-ceo-gojek/] to be processing over 2 billion\ntransactions per year.\n\nProduct:\nEven though many people know the company first and foremost as a ride-hailing\ncompany, getting a ride are just two of about twenty services Gojek has to\noffer.\n\nWhen you open the Gojek mobile app, there are several calls to action, but in\nthe top left corner is a focus on their payment features.\n\nWhen building a SuperApp (one app for many things) that integrates dozens of\nservices you can opt to build services in-house, have third-party APIs where\npeople can build their own apps, or have formal partnerships where you integrate\nanother company’s services into your app. While Gojek does a bit of each,\nthey’ve mostly built services in-house and relied on formal partnerships on the\nroad to SuperAppdom.\n\nGojek contains many services common to western counterparts like Uber. They have\nride-sharing (via car, ojek, taxi, etc.), food delivery, parcel delivery, and\nmoving services.\n\nSome of the more unique services they offer are:\n\n * GoTravel - a partnership with Bilbil.com) to book hotel rooms and longer\n   distance travel like planes and trains.\n * GoNews - a news aggregator that Gojek built in partnership with Kumparan.com,\n   a news start-up in Indonesia that Gojek also invested in via Go-Ventures.\n * GoPlay - a streaming service. Gojek partnered with Indonesian production\n   houses to produce new and platform-exclusive content they tout\n   [https://www.techinasia.com/gojek-launches-video-streaming-platform-goplay-indonesia] \n   as GoPlay Originals.\n * GoTix - a way to buy concert, sporting, and tourist attraction tickets\n * GoGames - a way to top-up mobile gaming credits\n * GoMed - a partnership with Halodoc for purchasing and delivering\n   medical-related goods.

Similarly to GoNews, chat is\n   one of the few services within Gojek that is not directly monetizable\n\nWhen looking across all of Gojek’s features and services, it’s important to note \nthat [https://blog.gojekengineering.com/what-is-a-super-app-4f2d889451e6]\n\n> “The biggest moat GOJEK built is payments. Once you’re handling money for a\nuser, you can build a castle of services within it.”[12]\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/gojek#_edn12]\nAn interesting aspect of Gojek (and other companies in Southeast Asia) is that\nthey have to onboard most of their users on to digital payments. In the early\ndays of Gojek, users paid their drivers with cash. There were no alternatives.\n\nNow, Gojek has a WIDE range of financial service offerings. Long-term when I\nthink about Gojek, they’re much more interesting as a financial services company\nthan as a ride-hailing service.\n\nThe core product underlying all of Gojek’s payment offerings is their mobile\nwallet GoPay, which was introduced in 2015. Like most of Southeast Asia,\nIndonesia’s population is largely unbanked. One of the onramps for GoPay was\nthat users could top-up their accounts via Gojek drivers. Users could give cash\nto a Gojek driver who would credit that to their account. Given the ubiquity of\ntheir drivers, Gojek became a branchless-bank with their drivers acting as bank\nbranches.\n\nAt first, GoPay was just a way to pay for Gojek services, but as of 2018\n[https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/11/13/indonesias-go-jek-sees-go-pay-spun-off-from-main-app-in-2018.html]\n, it began to act as an online and offline digital wallet that consumers could\nuse for Gojek services, non-Gojek online commerce, and offline commerce.\n\nPer a March 2019 Gojek blog post\n[https://medium.com/life-at-go-jek/shaping-the-future-of-payment-with-gojek-f6552a3c828]\n, “GO-PAY accounts for some 30 percent of the total electronic money\ntransactions in Indonesia.” Another post\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/what-is-a-super-app-4f2d889451e6] shares\nthat, “GO-PAY is accepted at close to 300,000 online and offline merchants in\nIndonesia, and processes $6.3 billion of annualized Gross Transaction Value\n(GTV)”\n\nIn addition to GoPay, the company has financial offerings including:\n\n * GoPulsa - to top up mobile minutes for pre-paid phone plans\n * GoBills - to pay bills ranging from everything from utilities to private\n   schools\n * GoPoints - similar to credit card reward points you can earn from using GoPay\n * GoInvestAsi - to buy and sell gold (when BTC?)\n * GoPayLater - a credit-like feature where you can pay off your bill at the end\n   of the month\n * GoSure - offers life, cracked screen, motorbike, travel, disaster, ticket\n   cancellation, and medical insurance\n\nI cut a lot of text from this section, but if you’d like to read 3,000 words\ngoing really in-depth on each of Gojek’s product offerings, you can find the\ntext that I cut from this post here\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmkrfLRqzfHNDBGx_ywDifPAGIEU5H-GgHK3yHz6HgM/edit?usp=sharing]\n.\n\n(Note from Ryan: I am still working on finding the balance of writing thorough\nyet to-the-point overviews.

Their goal was to turn Gojek\ninto the operating system of the phone. WeChat enjoys this luxury in China and\nGojek wanted the same relationship with Indonesians and other Southeast Asian\ncitizens. As I mentioned earlier, Gojek, in my estimation, seems to have relied\nmore on developing services in-house than other SuperApps and this was their\nchance to begin branching out.\n\nThe first product they rolled out with the TPP was Gonews (covered here\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/breaking-now-go-news-and-the-quest-for-engagement-f9ed65613679]\n). Since then, they have also rolled out additional products on the TPP\nincluding:\n\n●      GoGive (with Kitabisa [http://www.kitabisa.com/] — Indonesia’s largest\ncrowdfunding platform)\n\n●      GoMall (with jd.com, “Amazon of China” and an investor in Gojek)\n\n●      GoTravel (with tiket.com) to book hotel rooms. Eventually, you will be\nable to also book train and plane tickets.\n\n●      GoSure (with PasarPolis) - Insurance products covered above\n\n●      GoEd (with Zenius Education) to offer free online learning\n\nAnd many more to come…\n\nAt a high-level, it seems like right now, Gojek’s third-party platform is still\noperating in a very closed manner where you get included by entering into a\npartnership with Gojek. It’s not (yet?) a completely open ecosystem where anyone\ncan add a new application or digital storefront for their small retail business.\nI imagine this is something that will become more ‘open’ over time. I also\nunderstand why in the early days, they want to keep the ecosystem closed (and\nquality very high).\n\nCompetitors:\nIn the race for Super App domination of SEA, Grab is Gojek’s biggest competitor.\nUber was in the race until it sold its Southeast Asia operations to Grab.\n\nIronically,  Gojek’s co-founder and previous CEO and Grab’s co-founder/CEO both\nattended Harvard Business School at the same time and were friends. (Apparently,\nthey don’t talk much these days)\n\nIn the Grab vs. Gojek battle, Gojek feels like the Lyft of Southeast Asia. The\nfact that Grab acquired Uber’s Southeast Asia operations strengthens that\ncomparison.\n\nGojek has more services than Grab, but Gojek has not done well to expand outside\nof their home market, and there’s some debate that they’re no longer even the\ndominant player in Indonesia. ABI Research says\n[https://theinsiderstories.com/grab-leads-11-4-ride-hailing-in-asia-pacific-abi-research-finds/] \nthat Grab has 60%+ market share in Indonesia, a figure which Gojek disputes\n[https://fortune.com/longform/grab-gojek-super-apps/#:~:text=Even%20in%20Indonesia%20itself%2C%20Grab,Go%2DJek%20disputes%20that%20figure.]\n.\n\nInternational Expansion\nIn 2017, Gojek’s internal teams, led by their COO decided it was time for the\ncompany to begin expanding beyond\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/to-new-frontiers-how-gojek-went-international-f2fd632f60fc] \nIndonesia (3 years after Grab began international expansion). Gojek looked for\nmarkets with similar characteristics as Indonesia (growing mobile penetration,\nno food delivery market, and no dominant digital wallet).\n\nIn May of 2018, Gojek announced\n[https://www.gojek.com/blog/gojek/go-jek-to-launch-international-expansion-into-four-new-markets/] \ntheir intentions to commit $500M towards expansion plans across Southeast Asia,\nspecifically Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines. This was\nannounced just two months after Grab acquired Uber’s SEA operations which gave\nGrab Uber’s operations in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the\nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n\nThe plan for Gojek was to begin with ridesharing in Vietnam, Thailand,\nSingapore, and the Philippines, and then offer those new users other Gojek Super\nApp features. They planned to hire and work with local management teams to lead\neach of these initiatives.\n\nBesides just having local teams, each of these new markets would have unique\nbranding (Vietnam: Go-VIET, Thailand: GET, etc.).\n\nAs of November 2019, it seems\n[https://jakartaglobe.id/business/gointernational-gojek-seeks-more-southeast-asian-expansion] \nGojek’s user breakdown was still 80% Indonesia / 20% international, though they\nhope to get to 50/50 in the next 5 years.\n\nSide note: I visited Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines in 2019 and I used\nGrab in all of these countries. I think this was because I knew they had merged\nwith Uber’s SEA operations and I trusted Uber, but as a foreign visitor, using\nGojek was not even a consideration.\n\nSide-Side Note: If you’d like to dig deeper on where Gojek has struggled with\nInternational Expansion, I cut 1,000 words out of this post that you can find \nhere\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/18830mRxQ37V_7uypsqH4J30uNA792AInDfNx-IDWzRQ/edit?usp=sharing]\n.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCommentary:\nPolitical Connections & Nationalism\nOne thing that stood out about Gojek (at least as compared to Uber/Lyft) is that\nthey really made an effort to support their drivers and make them feel like they\nwere integral parts of the organization.\n\n> “Drivers who could not afford a smartphone were given loans to buy one;\nassistance was granted to those who didn’t have the necessary paperwork to\nregister legally as a Go-Jek driver. Drivers flaunted their association with the\napp via branded attire and accessories, which quickly made the streets of\nJakarta stream with Go-Jek’s signature shade of green.”Source\n[https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/lessons-go-jek]\nStrong political affiliations since the company’s earliest days also appear to\nhave paid dividends.  From the start, Gojek seems to have taken a “work with\ngovernment” approach (again, contrary to USA’s ride-hailing companies).\n\nIn Indonesia, Gojek works under the slogan “Karya Anak Bangsa” (made by the\nchildren of the nation).\n\nAs a result of their approach, they’ve gotten support from people in high\nplaces. In December of 2015, Ingasius Jonan, the transportation minister of\nIndonesia, was rebuked by the President for attempting to ban the use of\npersonal vehicles by Gojek drivers. This was seen as an effort to defend the\ntaxi industry. In response, Nadiem tweeted\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-transportation/indonesian-president-rebukes-minister-over-ride-hailing-crackdown-idUSKBN0U10CF20151218]\n, “Thanks to President @Jokowi for his support to 200 thousand Go-Jek drivers\nand 8-million of our application users,”\n\nThen, 7 months later in July of 2016, Indonesia’s President removed Ignasius\nfrom his role as transportation minister.\n\nIn their marketing language, Gojek (and Go-VIET and GET) make strong nationalist\nappeals that likely go a long way with government officials. The jackets for\neach country’s drivers are the color of their flag and have their national flags\nembroidered.\n\n^Vietnam\n\n^Indonesia\n\nOn the page for GoFood [https://www.gojek.com/gofood/], it says, “Do you realize\nthat your order improves the Indonesian economy as well as the Indonesian\nsociety? Contributing IDR19 trillion in 2018!”\n\nAll companies should talk about their contributions to a country in terms of how\nmany people they employ and (if the impact is big enough) their total\ncontribution to GDP. Per an earlier statistic, Gojek Indonesia employs about\n0.75% of the country in some form.\n\nWhen Nadiem took on his role in the President’s cabinet, he said\n[https://blog.gojekengineering.com/a-new-era-for-gojek-4d98d0e6eab4],\n\n> “We’ve created Gojek. An iconic company that flies the flag for the future of\nIndonesia and Southeast Asia.”\n> “This company has changed the lives of so many people in Indonesia and around\nthe region, and our key priority is to ensure that we can continue to act as a\npositive force in society for the foreseeable future.”\nIn a 2017 blog post, Gojek highlights:\n\n * They lifted the standard of living for 300,000 Indonesian drivers/partners\n * That after becoming a ‘unicorn’ they increased driver’s average monthly\n   income by 15%\n * That merchants using GoFood did up to 345% more in sales.\n\nA 2019 report\n[https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/gojek-contributed-3b-in-added-value-to-indonesias-economy-study-128194/] \nhighlighted that Gojek contributed more than $3 billion USD in added value to\nthe Indonesian economy in the prior year and that the average driver earned \nmore\nthan\n[http://ldfebui.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ENG-version-Press-Release-Fact-Sheet_LD-FEB-UI-Research-2018.pdf] \nthe Indonesian minimum wage.\n\nGojek also makes it a point in their posts to highlight how much they’ve been\nable to help small businesses throughout Indonesia. Over 50% of Indonesia’s GDP\ncontribution comes from “micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME)”.  It makes\nsense that the government would want to support Gojek if so much of what they do\nis helping this important section of GDP contribution grow.\n\nThrough all of Gojek’s offerings, they’re able to help MSMEs with business\nmanagement and efficiency (Gobiz), financial inclusion (Gopay), market access\n(Goride) and marketing (Gofood).\n\nGojek has a program called GO-JEK WIRAUSAHA (“Gojek Entrepreneur”) where they \nhave\n[https://medium.com/life-at-go-jek/how-go-jek-helps-small-businesses-overcome-their-top-5-biggest-challenges-48cd59a48e8] \n“trained more than 700 SMEs across Indonesia, to either start a new\nentrepreneurial business, or scale their existing business. Merchants\nimplementing our business insights experience an average of 71% increase in\nsales volume.”\n\nSales/Distribution:\nI recently read Seeing Like a State\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20186.Seeing_Like_a_State] by James C.\nScott. It is an incredibly dense book. One message I took away was that\ngovernments often want to create legibility in communities they govern. They\ntake a top-down approach to try and get communities to adjust themselves to how\nthe central authority wants the world to work. This is done to make governance\neasier for the central authority.\n\nGojek embodies the opposite of this in the best way possible. Rather than\nsitting at HQ and saying “what we did in Indonesia will work in Vietnam” Gojek\nhas taken a boots-on-the-ground approach to growth in new markets.\n\nThey hire local leadership teams, promote national colors in each of their\nregional markets, and get deeply integrated with their merchant partners.\n\nIn Vietnam, they say\n[https://techsauce.co/tech-and-biz/an-exclusive-interview-with-gojek-on-the-expansion-into-sea]\n, “Together with the local co-founders of GO-VIET and GET, we believed that it\nwas important to have local brands to reflect the nature of the highly localized\napp. We believe that these local brands will work best in these markets.” (TBD\nif this is true or not)\n\nIn the home market of Indonesia, Gojek realized early (because of their local\nknowledge) that competing against taxis would lead to going up against\nregulators on day one. By the time they started offering car rides a few years\ninto their existence, they already had a chance and did earn the good graces of\nthe government.\n\nThe company also recognized how important their drivers were and did many things\nto make them feel important\n[https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/lessons-go-jek].\n\n> “They held a string of huge, street-fair-style driver recruitment events in\nbasketball stadiums, signing on drivers by the tens of thousands. Drivers who\ncould not afford a smartphone were given loans to buy one; assistance was\ngranted to those who didn’t have the necessary paperwork to register legally as\na Go-Jek driver. Drivers flaunted their association with the app via branded\nattire and accessories, which quickly made the streets of Jakarta stream with\nGo-Jek’s signature shade of green.”\nAcquisitions and Investments:\nGojek is an active investor in and acquirer of other companies. They’ve invested\nin about 15 companies, many of which they’ve partnered with on different\nproduct/service offerings.\n\nThey’ve also acquired about 13 companies. Gojek has made most of its\nacquisitions in two categories. (1) Acquisitions to strengthen their payments\noffering (2) Acquisitions of Indian dev shops/acquisitions to strengthen their\nrecruiting and engineering pool.\n\nI broke out the section on their acquisitions and investments in a Google Doc \nhere\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NNIThUCUkekh6TsY0t7Jz1KIdoZqD2b45RTeqvOE5jY/edit?usp=sharing]\n.\n\nSuperApp\nAfter my next two posts on Grab and WeChat, I am going to write a longer post on\nSuperApps (commonalities, differences, thoughts on how to build one), but for\nnow, I’ll do a brief overview in the context of Gojek.\n\nThe best way to think about a SuperApp is that it is the OS of the phone.\n\nBen Thompson has covered this\n[https://stratechery.com/2017/apples-china-problem/] in the context of WeChat:\n\n> “In China the most important layer of the smartphone stack is not the phone’s\noperating system. Rather, it is WeChat. Or, to put it another way, the operating\nsystem of China is WeChat, not iOS/Android”\nBesides being able to put “super” in front of your name (which is cool), there\nare great financial rewards to this. Imagine if every time you opened your phone\ninstead of deciding whether to click on iMessage, Uber, Doordash, Apple News,\nChase, YouTube, Netflix, and Booking.com, you only had to click on one app,\nGojek, and then within Gojek, you had their “Go” equivalent of all the above\nchoices. That’s a SuperApp.\n\nEach of the applications within a SuperApp also has the potential to make each\nother stronger. e.g., Because your GoPay is connected to your GoTix, you can buy\ntickets with 1-click.\n\nGojek is very heavy-handed on calling themselves a super app. Type superapp.is\ninto your URL search bar and it will take you to a Gojek engineering recruiting\nwebsite.\n\nFacebook (WhatsApp) + Gojek\nSo why did Facebook (and PayPal) invest in Gojek?\n\nOn the Facebook side, this is a chance to further integrate within the\nIndonesian economy. WhatsApp already has 60M users in Indonesia (~25% of total\npopulation) and 75% of the country’s mobile phone messaging app users. Per \neMarketer\n[https://www.emarketer.com/content/daily-forecast-whatsapp-dominates-mobile-messaging-in-indonesia]\n:\n\nIn April, Reuters reported\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-indonesia/facebook-three-indonesian-firms-in-early-talks-for-mobile-payment-approval-sources-idUSKBN2220UF] \nthat Facebook was preparing to apply for regulatory approval in Indonesia in\norder to launch a mobile payment service in the country in partnership with a\nlocal FinTech firm. At the time, Reuters reported that FB was looking to partner\nwith Gojek, OVO, or LinkAja. I saw one article say\n[https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/facebook-and-paypal-invest-in-southeast-asian-ride-hailing-giant-gojek/] \nthat “For Gojek, they will be able to embed Facebook’s digital wallet offering\n(like WhatsApp Pay) on their platform of lifestyle services across shopping,\ntransport etc.”, but I can’t think of any reason why Gojek would want to invite\nWhatsApp pay to compete with them in their own app.\n\nA more likely scenario is that, Facebook properties (Facebook.com, Facebook\nMessenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) are the only apps in Indonesia that have\nmore users than Gojek. If WhatsApp roles out mini-programs (Mini-programs are\nlittle downloadable apps that run inside another larger app. I’ll cover this in\nmy WeChat issue.) and Gojek has an exclusive agreement (aka, no Grab allowed) to\nbuild out their product on top of this, it could help to cement their winning\nposition in Indonesia.\n\nIt’s worth noting that all PR comments and the FB newsroom post\n[https://about.fb.com/news/2020/06/gojek-investment-indonesia-small-businesses/] \nannouncing the investment all came from WhatsApp, specifically COO Matt Idema\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-idema-20a119/].\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Gojek rolled out GoChat in April 2019. It’s possible that\nthat feature is seeing little usage because of WhatsApp’s existing dominance so\nmaybe they decide to kill Gochat, build a Gojek “mini-program” on top of\nWhatsApp, and ‘The Facebook Company’ decided to not compete with Gojek on\npayments in Indonesia.\n\nTime will tell…\n\nExit:\nGiven how much money Gojek has raised, it seems like the most likely path they\nhave to an exit is an IPO. They have spoken openly about considering an IPO once\ntheir user base hits 50% Indonesia / 50% rest of the world, which given earlier\ncomments, they predict could happen around 2024.\n\nWith the recent investment from Facebook, it got me thinking that Gojek could be\na key piece of what Facebook needs to turn WhatsApp into a SuperApp (this is a\nstretch).\n\nPrior to the Facebook investment, there were talks that Softbank (a Grab\ninvestor) is pushing for\n[https://www.ft.com/content/075162ba-5dff-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4] some kind of\nbroad deal between Grab and Gojek, but details were light.\n\nWith new leadership at Gojek, there could be an opportunity for an\nacquisition/merger with Grab, especially given that Grab has picked up more\nmarket share in other SEA countries than Gojek has. This would give both\ncompanies an opportunity to stop burning cash and really dominate Southeast\nAsia.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558899293-c6204574fcd4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-11T18:45:12.000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-01T21:40:39.000Z","published_at":"2020-06-21T18:47:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Gojek

Its core value prop was <a href=\"https://www.grab.com/my/press/consumers-drivers/myteksi-celebrates-taxi-drivers/\">being</a> a “taxi-dispatch service with GPS-enhancements, allowing passengers to hail the nearest taxi with extreme ease.” This was an improvement for drivers who spent less time idly cruising for passengers.</p><p>Besides figuring out the intricacies of ride-hailing, one of the big hurdles that Grab seems to have solved was that not all drivers would have a smartphone.</p><p><a href=\"https://entrepreneurship.hbs.edu/founders/Pages/profile.aspx?num=195\">From</a> their original HBS plans for <em>MyTeksi</em>:</p><blockquote><em>“The drivers would be supplied with smartphones so they could communicate directly with prospective customers, thus saving valuable time and money wasted in driving endlessly seeking fares […] Unlike Uber, which has upset local taxi markets by launching a competitive force to cab drivers, GrabTaxi is working with taxi drivers to help them do better business.”</em></blockquote><p>Grab bought smartphones in bulk and gave them to drivers who paid off the phones with daily installments.</p><p>It was also a huge improvement for riders who felt much safer with Grab. “Grab lets riders retrieve drivers’ police records through the app and share routes and license plate numbers with friends and family. The app also masks passengers’ phone numbers on the driver’s end as an <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/07/for-some-platforms-network-effects-are-no-match-for-local-know-how\">additional</a> safety precaution.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-10/harvard-inspires-man-to-ditch-family-riches-for-taxis\">As of June 2014</a>, Grab was available in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines and had 250,000 active users and more than 25,000 drivers. Around this time they also expanded their offering by adding GrabCar (where anyone with a car, not only taxis, could drive) along with GrabBike (similar to Gojek’s core offering).</p><p>From launch through early 2015, all Grab payments were done <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/11/grabtaxi-cashless-payments/\">using</a> cash. This put the impetus on drivers to have to pay Grab for each ride that they delivered on. It seems like this is worked by drivers keeping a tab of sorts with Grab that they’d have to pay off after some period of time. Even though payment wasn’t happening in the app early on, ride amounts were still <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/grabtaxi-make-money\">tracked</a> there.</p><p>In 2016, Grab rebranded MyTeksi in Malaysia to also be under the Grab umbrella, <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2016/01/28/grab-rebranding/\">centralizing</a> its branding across Southeast Asia. This stands in contrast to Gojek’s approach of using local branding in each new market.</p><p>In the background, Uber continued to be the elephant in the room. Uber was spending money to expand through the world, with a strong focus on Asia. Uber <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/29/uber-focuses-on-services-as-it-begins-to-see-profits-in-southeast-asia/\">entered</a> key markets like Singapore in 2013, Vietnam in 2014, and by 2016 was in 15 cities across Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. I believe what allowed Grab, Gojek, Didi, etc. to prevail in their regions is that they had a better local understanding. Uber tried to launch UberMoto (motorcycle hailing) but they did not have the same local understanding of these markets that the homegrown companies did. When Uber entered these markets, they went by car first and then motorcycle later. Companies like Grab did the opposite, taxi, motorcycle, then car (because that’s what consumers were more familiar with). Anthony was quoted as <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grab-vs-jek-inside-asia-103044147.html\">saying</a></p><blockquote><em>“Grab prevailed over Uber, Anthony argues, because it adapted to local consumers’ needs. In a relatively low-income region, Grab provided a platform for cheap taxis and motorcycles to counter Uber’s expensive “black cars.”</em></blockquote><p>Each of these countries has smaller, homegrown options as well. For example, the Philippines have 10+ ride-hailing startups. In most of these markets though, it was Uber vs. Grab (and later on, vs Gojek too).</p><p>By 2018, Uber had a new CEO at the helm and was looking to stop “[taking] on too many battles across too many fronts and with too many competitors.” Uber <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Grab-faces-2bn-payout-to-Uber-if-no-IPO-by-2023\">agreed</a> to combine their SEA business with Grab in exchange for a 27.5% equity stake in Grab that would convert to $2 billion in cash if Grab doesn’t go public by 2023. Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi also took a board seat at Grab. The two companies were later <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4cb3b76c-bfb9-11e8-8d55-54197280d3f7\">fined</a> $9.5 million (arguably pennies considering the deal size) by Singaporean regulators over an “anti-competitive deal”.</p><p>After acquiring Uber’s SEA operations, Grab embarked on the journey of becoming a Super App (“One app for multiple services” in Grab’s words). They wanted to become a platform company composed of technology, people, and operational “on the ground” infrastructure.</p><p>They <a href=\"https://www.grab.com/sg/press/business/grab-unveils-open-platform-strategy-to-build-southeast-asias-first-everyday-superapp/\">defined</a> their strategy as:</p><blockquote><em>“Partners can expand more efficiently across Southeast Asia by leveraging Grab’s user base and Southeast Asia’s largest distribution channels through GrabPlatform, a suite of APIs that enables partners to access components of Grab’s technology like logistics and payments.”</em></blockquote><p>By this point in 2018, Grab had secured more than 100 million downloads of its app and crossed 2 billion rides across all markets. This is when they brought on their first platform partner, grocery delivery service, HappyFresh (the Instacart of SEA).</p><p>In 2018, Grab <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-10/grab-opens-its-app-in-an-attempt-to-build-a-tencent-like-service\">surpassed</a> $1 billion in revenue and with the integration of Uber’s SEA operations, it was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-06/ride-hailing-giant-grab-expects-to-double-revenue-in-2019\">expected</a> to do $2 billion in 2019.</p><p>By October of 2019, Grab was operating in 339 cities across 8 SEA <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26268bfe-40a8-11e9-b896-fe36ec32aece\">countries</a>. The Grab app had been <a href=\"https://assets.grab.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Grab-Corporate-Profile-Oct-2019.pdf\">downloaded</a> over 166 million times and had over 9 million drivers and merchants on the platform.</p><h2 id=\"product\"><strong><strong>Product</strong></strong></h2><p>Similar to Gojek, when you open the Grab app, there are a lot of services fighting for your attention. To use the comparison to an operating system, if you look at the bottom dock of the Grab app, the features that sit there are activity history, payments, chat, and settings -- showing the focus they have on payments and the newer chat feature. Chat seems like an awkward feature to have in an app focused on services, but WeChat’s success in building a product in the opposite direction (chat first then paid services) seems to make other SuperApps feel the need to tack the feature on eventually.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F62766474-538f-4323-bc09-f7a6d3439b30_803x1600.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Grab has relied on partnerships and their third-party app platform to build out a lot of their services.

They <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-grab-m-a-mufg-idUSKCN20J0NM\">plan</a> to offer lending, insurance and wealth management products and services for Southeast Asian consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>Their core financial product, GrabPay, was launched in January of 2016. GrabPay is Grab’s mobile wallet solution to help “bank” the populations they operate in.</p><p>Through GrabPay you can link your debit or credit card, top up your e-wallet with direct bank connections, use Grab services like transport or food, send funds to other people, and make in-person payments.</p><p>In November of 2017, they made a big jump by rolling out GrabPay for third-party merchants. Similar to Chinese payment companies, GrabPay users became able to pay for in-person purchases with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/01/grab-takes-a-big-step-into-digital-payments/\">QR codes</a>.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59d1a5d8-bd92-473c-be26-fa3445b2c2e6_659x392.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A screenshot of a cell phone\n\nDescription automatically generated\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>One of the most important features Grab offers to its GrabPay users is an easy way to move money in and out of the financial system. In markets like Indonesia (where Grab is partnered with OVO to offer GrabPay), users can top up their accounts with cash via their driver for no fees! This option is cheaper than ATM/bank <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2017/grabpay-middle-economy-cnp-transactions/\">transfers</a>.</p><blockquote><em>“If people have cash in a system and can’t get it out, they want to get it out,” Thompson said. <strong>“If they have cash in a system and know they are able to get it out, that makes them relax, and they actually leave more money in the system</strong>. Our customers leave a lot in our wallet because they’re confident that they can get it out when they need it.”</em></blockquote><p>GrabPay operates natively in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines. In Indonesia, Grab is partnered with the local e-money platform, OVO. In Vietnam, Grab is partnered with a local solution, Moca. In Thailand, Grab has announced but not yet launched its partnership with Kasikorn Bank.</p><p>They offer additional services including:</p><ul><li>GrabRewards - Similar to credit card rewards points. Highest tiers even get common credit card perks like preferential airport lounge rates</li><li>GrabGifts - Ways to send Grab gift cards to other users</li></ul><p>Grab Finance for Drivers -</p><ul><li>Upfront Cash -  where drivers could take out a loan against their future earnings</li><li>Shop Now, Pay Later for Smartphones - part of their initial value prop for drivers to get a smartphone</li><li>Grab Finance for Merchants offers business loans and lines of credit to SME merchants</li><li>Grab Insure - a suite of “microinsurance” options for its drivers, merchants, and riders, appealing to SEA lower-income individuals. Some of their plans are pennies per day. Some of Grab’s markets -- specifically Indonesia -- are some of the least insured populations in the world.</li></ul><p>Gojek and Grab have taken different approaches to rolling out new offerings and to Gojek’s credit, they have WAY more offerings than Grab does.</p><p>Grab has made fewer acquisitions (3) than Gojek (12) and chooses to partner with other companies to offer many of its new services whereas Gojek builds or brings (via acquisition) more services in-house. Only in April of 2019,  did Gojek introduce their third-party platform.</p><p><a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/building-a-strong-superapp-ecosystem-in-southeast-asia/\">From</a> Aditi Sharma, Grab’s Director and Head of Startup Programs &amp; Investments:</p><blockquote><em>“It is clear from the beginning that doing this all by ourselves is not entirely practical. Strategically it makes more sense for us to build a healthy ecosystem of partners around our users. “Hence we are constantly seeking quality partners in the ecosystem to work with on our everyday superapp vision,”</em></blockquote><p>High-level, Grab has done international expansion better than Gojek. And it does seem like Grab is fast-following Gojek on its ambitions to become a SuperApp. Nadiem (Gojek co-founder) was quoted <a href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/grab-gojek-super-apps/\">saying</a>,</p><blockquote><em>“It’s really interesting that Grab has started to try to take that word away from us. I’m like, ‘Excuse me?’ You spend the first years of your life copying Uber? And then the next three years of your life copying Go-Jek?”</em></blockquote><p>For a granular look at Grab’s product offerings follow <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MxAUxf-lJnpHWs3HwjpUK13yM825HFXQzW9RabtgaLs/edit\">this link</a> to my additional write-up on the topic.</p><h2 id=\"competitors\"><strong><strong>Competitors</strong></strong></h2><p>Per App Annie’s data <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04e0523c-2256-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2bmi\">reported</a> in the Financial Times, Gojek is beating Grab in Gojek’s home market of Indonesia (which makes sense since Gojek has focused most of their efforts on Indonesia). Grab is winning in every other Southeast Asian market.</p><p>I believe Gojek recognizes this, and it is the core reason why they have been quicker at rolling out additional services within their app (Gojek: “If we’re going to lose on geographies, maybe we can win on services”).</p><p>While Grab and Gojek have a lot of overlapping services (transport, insurance, food, groceries) Gojek has more of a long tail of services (most of the GoLife offerings like massages and home cleaning are unique to Gojek).</p><p>Each company has raised a ton of money from a great set of institutional and strategic investors.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd72d8dca-4400-4a4d-af89-6b04d03a1097_700x578.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A graphic with no description\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04e0523c-2256-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b\">Overall</a>, “Gojek operates in 207 cities across four countries in Southeast Asia, 203 of which are in Indonesia.

Lyft partnered with Ola (India), Grab (SEA), and Didi (China) to offer Lyft users traveling abroad the ability to book rides in India, SEA, and China using Ola, Grab, and Didi’s services directly through the Lyft app (and vice versa).</p><p>The partnerships with Didi and Grab were called off after Uber left China and SEA and took ownership of stakes in Didi and Grab.</p><h2 id=\"uber\"><strong><strong>Uber</strong></strong></h2><p>Doing all this work on Gojek and Grab gives me an incredible respect for Travis Kalanick’s call to expand rapidly into all of these global markets and then also gives me great respect for Dara Khosrowshahi’s call to exit all these markets via buying large stakes in competitors.</p><p>Uber stock is basically an index of all global ride-hailing companies (27.5% of SEA via Grab, 37% of Russia via Yandex, 18.8% of China via DiDi, 100% of the middle east via Careem, indirect ownership of Brazil via 99app.com, which DiDi owns). One article describes Uber’s actions perfectly, <a href=\"https://knowledge.insead.edu/entrepreneurship/the-real-story-behind-ubers-exit-from-southeast-asia-10096\">saying</a></p><blockquote><em>“Uber seemed to invest just enough to prevent rivals like Grab from tipping the market to their platform […] Uber’s response was reasonable – it invested just enough to prevent these well-funded local players from tipping its markets. By doing so, Uber maximized the value of its business with the minimum investment. When consolidation came, Uber was able to secure a large percentage of Grab’s equity – reportedly 27.5%– in exchange for exiting the market. Arguably, Uber learnt the lesson in China, where it exited the market with 17.7 percent of Didi’s business. Thus, Uber will benefit from the Asian ride-sharing market growth long into the future.</em>”</blockquote><h2 id=\"acquisitions-and-investments\"><strong><strong>Acquisitions and Investments</strong></strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://ventures.grab.com/\">GrabVentures</a></p><p>Grab Ventures is Grab’s incubator, accelerator, and investment vehicle.</p><p>On the incubator side, within Grab Ventures, they’ve incubated: GrabFresh, GrabKitchen, and GrabWheels. Each seems to be structured differently.</p><ul><li><strong>GrabWheels</strong>, is the mobility arm of Grab, focused on developing two-wheeler electric vehicles (EV) solutions (scooters). The unit has its own CEO, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tj-tham-88987448/?originalSubdomain=id\">Tj Tham</a>, who moved into the role in November, 2018 after spending 5.5 years at other functions within Grab.

It doesn’t appear this division has its own CEO (like GrabWheels). Right now, it seems like they invite merchants to set up stalls in a food court-like atmosphere. While there are dine-in options, most business comes from delivery options.</li><li><strong>GrabFresh</strong> is a partnership with HappyFresh (the Instacart of SEA). HappyFresh went through some ups and downs since launch in 2015, having to pull out of some markets and bring in a new CEO. In 2019, HappyFresh raised a Series C with Grab Ventures participating.

Per a Grab PR, <em>“Ikaaz’s technology stack encompasses a range of innovations, such as NFC, QR-code, audio-based payments as well as bill payments, online payments, and P2P. This flexibility and scalability make it ideally suited for Southeast Asia’s diverse payments landscape and large unbanked population.”</em></li><li>Bento: This acquisition serves as the starting point for what will become GrabInvest. GrabInvest aims to democratize access to retail wealth management products, in order to provide millions across Southeast Asia with the opportunity to save and invest in financial products traditionally limited to affluent individuals and institutional investors.</li><li>Youche: Not much information on this one, other than a mention in a TC article. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/02/grab-buys-kudo/\">Apparently</a> Grab bought this small Chinese ride-hailing company in 2013 to form it’s Beijing office.</li></ol><p>When Grab raised billions of dollars in 2019, they said they were planning to use that to make ~6 acquisitions, but since that fundraise, they have only made 1 public acquisition of Bento (2020).</p><p>Grab is notably less acquisitive than its competitor Gojek. As a result, Grab has a smaller product/service offering than Gojek (which built most of its services out via acquisition).

From my Gojek post:</p><blockquote><em>When Gojek launched their app in 2015, they had drawn inspiration from Uber and Lyft, but made the conscious effort to launch with more than just ridesharing. They did not believe ridesharing alone could create a strong enough network effect for the business. They launched with motorbike ridesharing, delivery (Go-Food), and shopping (Go-Send). My sense of what was going on in the background here was that Gojek’s main competitor, Grab launched in 2012 and by 2014, was beginning to expand ridesharing into Indonesia. Gojek did not want to lose their home market and wanted to give users multiple reasons to use their app so they launched with several applications for users whereas, at this point, Grab was only ridesharing.</em></blockquote><p>Launch dates in SEA countries:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffe398a82-1550-4518-8253-b7db7876109f_770x388.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A screenshot of a cell phone\n\nDescription automatically generated\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>In Indonesia, Grab is competing against native Gojek.

She stayed at McKinsey in San Francisco for 1 year (Jan. ’12 – Jan.\n’13) before going on to Salesforce in San Francisco for 2 years (Feb ’13 – March\n’15).

The idea (originally named MyTeksi) was the \nrunner-up [https://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/Pages/2011businessplancontest.aspx] \nwinner in the HBS New Venture Competition in 2011.\n\nFrom the beginning, the idea was for a mobile app to match taxi drivers and\nriders (compare this to Gojek which started as a call center to match ojeks and\nriders).\n\nAnthony and Hooi Ling (who goes by “Ling”) both grew up in Malaysia and knew the\nproblems of the taxi industry firsthand. Ling has said that Malaysia \nhistorically\n[https://thecoverage.my/malaysia-rank-world-no-1-for-the-worst-taxi-drivers-in-the-world/] \nhas had some of the world’s worst taxi services ranging from drivers who refuse\nto use the meter to outright rude and aggressive behavior.\n\nThe app launched in Malaysia in 2012. Its core value prop was being\n[https://www.grab.com/my/press/consumers-drivers/myteksi-celebrates-taxi-drivers/] \na “taxi-dispatch service with GPS-enhancements, allowing passengers to hail the\nnearest taxi with extreme ease.” This was an improvement for drivers who spent\nless time idly cruising for passengers.\n\nBesides figuring out the intricacies of ride-hailing, one of the big hurdles\nthat Grab seems to have solved was that not all drivers would have a smartphone.\n\nFrom [https://entrepreneurship.hbs.edu/founders/Pages/profile.aspx?num=195] \ntheir original HBS plans for MyTeksi:\n\n> “The drivers would be supplied with smartphones so they could communicate\ndirectly with prospective customers, thus saving valuable time and money wasted\nin driving endlessly seeking fares […] Unlike Uber, which has upset local taxi\nmarkets by launching a competitive force to cab drivers, GrabTaxi is working\nwith taxi drivers to help them do better business.”\nGrab bought smartphones in bulk and gave them to drivers who paid off the phones\nwith daily installments.\n\nIt was also a huge improvement for riders who felt much safer with Grab. “Grab\nlets riders retrieve drivers’ police records through the app and share routes\nand license plate numbers with friends and family. The app also masks\npassengers’ phone numbers on the driver’s end as an additional\n[https://hbr.org/2018/07/for-some-platforms-network-effects-are-no-match-for-local-know-how] \nsafety precaution.”\n\nAs of June 2014\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-10/harvard-inspires-man-to-ditch-family-riches-for-taxis]\n, Grab was available in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and\nthe Philippines and had 250,000 active users and more than 25,000 drivers.\nAround this time they also expanded their offering by adding GrabCar (where\nanyone with a car, not only taxis, could drive) along with GrabBike (similar to\nGojek’s core offering).\n\nFrom launch through early 2015, all Grab payments were done using\n[https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/11/grabtaxi-cashless-payments/] cash. This put\nthe impetus on drivers to have to pay Grab for each ride that they delivered on.\nIt seems like this is worked by drivers keeping a tab of sorts with Grab that\nthey’d have to pay off after some period of time. Even though payment wasn’t\nhappening in the app early on, ride amounts were still tracked\n[https://www.techinasia.com/grabtaxi-make-money] there.\n\nIn 2016, Grab rebranded MyTeksi in Malaysia to also be under the Grab umbrella, \ncentralizing\n[https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2016/01/28/grab-rebranding/] its\nbranding across Southeast Asia. This stands in contrast to Gojek’s approach of\nusing local branding in each new market.\n\nIn the background, Uber continued to be the elephant in the room. Uber was\nspending money to expand through the world, with a strong focus on Asia. Uber \nentered\n[https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/29/uber-focuses-on-services-as-it-begins-to-see-profits-in-southeast-asia/] \nkey markets like Singapore in 2013, Vietnam in 2014, and by 2016 was in 15\ncities across Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the\nPhilippines. I believe what allowed Grab, Gojek, Didi, etc. to prevail in their\nregions is that they had a better local understanding. Uber tried to launch\nUberMoto (motorcycle hailing) but they did not have the same local understanding\nof these markets that the homegrown companies did. When Uber entered these\nmarkets, they went by car first and then motorcycle later. Companies like Grab\ndid the opposite, taxi, motorcycle, then car (because that’s what consumers were\nmore familiar with). Anthony was quoted as saying\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grab-vs-jek-inside-asia-103044147.html]\n\n> “Grab prevailed over Uber, Anthony argues, because it adapted to local\nconsumers’ needs. In a relatively low-income region, Grab provided a platform\nfor cheap taxis and motorcycles to counter Uber’s expensive “black cars.”\nEach of these countries has smaller, homegrown options as well. For example, the\nPhilippines have 10+ ride-hailing startups. In most of these markets though, it\nwas Uber vs. Grab (and later on, vs Gojek too).\n\nBy 2018, Uber had a new CEO at the helm and was looking to stop “[taking] on too\nmany battles across too many fronts and with too many competitors.” Uber agreed\n[https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Grab-faces-2bn-payout-to-Uber-if-no-IPO-by-2023] \nto combine their SEA business with Grab in exchange for a 27.5% equity stake in\nGrab that would convert to $2 billion in cash if Grab doesn’t go public by 2023.\nUber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi also took a board seat at Grab. The two companies\nwere later fined\n[https://www.ft.com/content/4cb3b76c-bfb9-11e8-8d55-54197280d3f7] $9.5 million\n(arguably pennies considering the deal size) by Singaporean regulators over an\n“anti-competitive deal”.\n\nAfter acquiring Uber’s SEA operations, Grab embarked on the journey of becoming\na Super App (“One app for multiple services” in Grab’s words). They wanted to\nbecome a platform company composed of technology, people, and operational “on\nthe ground” infrastructure.\n\nThey defined\n[https://www.grab.com/sg/press/business/grab-unveils-open-platform-strategy-to-build-southeast-asias-first-everyday-superapp/] \ntheir strategy as:\n\n> “Partners can expand more efficiently across Southeast Asia by leveraging Grab’s\nuser base and Southeast Asia’s largest distribution channels through\nGrabPlatform, a suite of APIs that enables partners to access components of\nGrab’s technology like logistics and payments.”\nBy this point in 2018, Grab had secured more than 100 million downloads of its\napp and crossed 2 billion rides across all markets. This is when they brought on\ntheir first platform partner, grocery delivery service, HappyFresh (the\nInstacart of SEA).\n\nIn 2018, Grab surpassed\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-10/grab-opens-its-app-in-an-attempt-to-build-a-tencent-like-service] \n$1 billion in revenue and with the integration of Uber’s SEA operations, it was \nexpected\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-06/ride-hailing-giant-grab-expects-to-double-revenue-in-2019] \nto do $2 billion in 2019.\n\nBy October of 2019, Grab was operating in 339 cities across 8 SEA countries\n[https://www.ft.com/content/26268bfe-40a8-11e9-b896-fe36ec32aece].

To use the comparison to an operating system, if\nyou look at the bottom dock of the Grab app, the features that sit there are\nactivity history, payments, chat, and settings -- showing the focus they have on\npayments and the newer chat feature. Chat seems like an awkward feature to have\nin an app focused on services, but WeChat’s success in building a product in the\nopposite direction (chat first then paid services) seems to make other SuperApps\nfeel the need to tack the feature on eventually.\n\nGrab has relied on partnerships and their third-party app platform to build out\na lot of their services. They have many common services such as transportation\n(everything from cars to geographically unique options such as a ‘Thone Bane’ in\nMyanmar), good delivery, parcel delivery, and grocery delivery.\n\nSome more unique offerings they have:\n\n * GrabHealth - A telemedicine service for e-consultations and medicine delivery\n   via partnership with Ping An Health\n * Grab Entertainment - A way to buy movie tickets\n * Grab Subscriptions - Ways to buy ‘coupon books’ to restaurants and different\n   plans for frequent riders\n * Grab for Business - Portal for companies to manage rides for their employees.\n   Interesting because if they add other services like travel booking,\n   insurance, and direct payroll through Grab Wallet, this becomes like\n   JustWorks + Trip Actions + Uber + Bank account.\n * Grab Ads - For companies to buy car wrapping, in-car advertisements, in-car\n   product sampling space, in-car screen displays, sponsored in-app\n   communications, and more…\n * Grab Video (discontinued) - A streaming service in partnership with Hooq, but\n   Hooq went bankrupt\n\nThey have a large offering of financial products via Grab Financial and have\ninvested a lot in building out these services.

Lyft partnered with Ola\n(India), Grab (SEA), and Didi (China) to offer Lyft users traveling abroad the\nability to book rides in India, SEA, and China using Ola, Grab, and Didi’s\nservices directly through the Lyft app (and vice versa).\n\nThe partnerships with Didi and Grab were called off after Uber left China and\nSEA and took ownership of stakes in Didi and Grab.\n\nUber\nDoing all this work on Gojek and Grab gives me an incredible respect for Travis\nKalanick’s call to expand rapidly into all of these global markets and then also\ngives me great respect for Dara Khosrowshahi’s call to exit all these markets\nvia buying large stakes in competitors.\n\nUber stock is basically an index of all global ride-hailing companies (27.5% of\nSEA via Grab, 37% of Russia via Yandex, 18.8% of China via DiDi, 100% of the\nmiddle east via Careem, indirect ownership of Brazil via 99app.com, which DiDi\nowns). One article describes Uber’s actions perfectly, saying\n[https://knowledge.insead.edu/entrepreneurship/the-real-story-behind-ubers-exit-from-southeast-asia-10096]\n\n> “Uber seemed to invest just enough to prevent rivals like Grab from tipping the\nmarket to their platform […] Uber’s response was reasonable – it invested just\nenough to prevent these well-funded local players from tipping its markets. By\ndoing so, Uber maximized the value of its business with the minimum investment.\nWhen consolidation came, Uber was able to secure a large percentage of Grab’s\nequity – reportedly 27.5%– in exchange for exiting the market. Arguably, Uber\nlearnt the lesson in China, where it exited the market with 17.7 percent of\nDidi’s business.

The unit has its own CEO, Tj\n   Tham [https://www.linkedin.com/in/tj-tham-88987448/?originalSubdomain=id],\n   who moved into the role in November, 2018 after spending 5.5 years at other\n   functions within Grab. GrabWheels raised $30 million in outside capital from\n   Kwang Yang Motor Co, a Taiwanese EV leader.\n * GrabKitchen is Grab’s CloudKitchen division. As of Jan., 2020, they had about\n   50 cloud kitchens across 4 SEA countries and just launched\n   [https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/grab-launches-first-grabkitchen-singapore-10-restaurants] \n   their first in Singapore with 10 restaurants. It doesn’t appear this division\n   has its own CEO (like GrabWheels). Right now, it seems like they invite\n   merchants to set up stalls in a food court-like atmosphere. While there are\n   dine-in options, most business comes from delivery options.\n * GrabFresh is a partnership with HappyFresh (the Instacart of SEA). HappyFresh\n   went through some ups and downs since launch in 2015, having to pull out of\n   some markets and bring in a new CEO. In 2019, HappyFresh raised a Series C\n   with Grab Ventures participating. HappyFresh was also Grab’s first\n   third-party platform partner. The Grab website calls the offering “GrabFresh\n   (Powered by HappyFresh).\n\nOn the accelerator [https://ventures.grab.com/?page_id=220] side, they’ve put 15\ncompanies through the program to date and do 2 batches per year. Going through\nthe accelerator does not guarantee investment or a commercial partnership with\nGrab.\n\nSome of these include:\n\n * Tamasia: Gold buying and selling\n * My Cash Online: online store for migrants\n * Pergiumroh: Digitized “umroh” an Islam pilgrimage to mecca\n * Porter: logistics company\n * And many more…\n\nTo-date Grab has made 3 public acquisitions\n\nKudo: Kudo was a multi-part strategic acquisition for Grab. Grab wanted to\nexpand their GrabPay offering into Indonesia.\n\n 1. Kudo operates IRL kiosks throughout Indonesia helping people without bank\n    accounts or internet access buy online goods. Grab turned them into\n    “GrabKios” and added some offerings including package delivery (via a\n    company they accelerated called “Porter”), gold buying (via a company they\n    accelerated called “Tamasia”), and microinsurance\n    [https://e27.co/kudo-becomes-grabkios-marking-new-offers-aimed-at-larger-kiosks-digitisation-20191108/]\n    .\n 2. Grab ran into foreign ownership problems when they tried to expand their\n    digital wallet in Indonesia. The acquisition of Kudo helped them to \n    circumvent\n    [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grab-vs-jek-inside-asia-103044147.html] \n    these restrictions.\n 3. iKaaz: In Grab’s quest to become SEA’s “universal payments platform”, it\n    acquired Bangalore-based iKaaz. Per a Grab PR, “Ikaaz’s technology stack\n    encompasses a range of innovations, such as NFC, QR-code, audio-based\n    payments as well as bill payments, online payments, and P2P. This\n    flexibility and scalability make it ideally suited for Southeast Asia’s\n    diverse payments landscape and large unbanked population.”\n 4. Bento: This acquisition serves as the starting point for what will become\n    GrabInvest. GrabInvest aims to democratize access to retail wealth\n    management products, in order to provide millions across Southeast Asia with\n    the opportunity to save and invest in financial products traditionally\n    limited to affluent individuals and institutional investors.\n 5. Youche: Not much information on this one, other than a mention in a TC\n    article. Apparently [https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/02/grab-buys-kudo/] Grab\n    bought this small Chinese ride-hailing company in 2013 to form it’s Beijing\n    office.\n\nWhen Grab raised billions of dollars in 2019, they said they were planning to\nuse that to make ~6 acquisitions, but since that fundraise, they have only made\n1 public acquisition of Bento (2020).\n\nGrab is notably less acquisitive than its competitor Gojek. As a result, Grab\nhas a smaller product/service offering than Gojek (which built most of its\nservices out via acquisition). Grab also seems to be pushing their third-party\nplatform more than Gojek, in an effort to partner with other companies rather\nthan buy them.\n\nCommentary\nKnow-your-customer isn’t just a Compliance Standard\nFor a lot of companies looking at Southeast Asia today, I think they envision\nthe same kind of opportunities that an entrepreneur looking at China 10 or 20\nyears ago would have seen. A country (countries) with growing wealth, coming\nonline quickly via smartphones, and a nascent payment landscape.\n\nThe Southeast Asia opportunity gets grouped into one but is actually 10\ncountries with deep cultural differences throughout (many languages, many\nislands, etc.).\n\nEach requires boots on the ground knowledge and unique infrastructure.\n\nThough they do have shared problems around safety, infrastructure, and shared\n“Asian cultures” and values, each new SEA country that one of these companies\nenters, requires real local knowledge.\n\nFrom a Fortune article:\n\n> Just after Uber’s [ice cream event], Grab offered what Malaysians really scream\nfor: smelly durians. Customers in Kuala Lumpur, the capital, could have one of\nthe pungent fruits rushed to their doorstep by a Grab driver. To deliver on that\npromise, Grab had to devise special packaging: Durians, though considered a\ngreat delicacy, emit an odor so overpowering that they are banned in many\nairports and hotels. Grab surmounted that obstacle and offered the fruits at the\nbargain price of a single ringgit (24¢). They sold out almost immediately, and\nthe “GrabDurian” marketing coup is now well into its fourth year.\nUber’s flaw -- and Grab’s success -- in Southeast Asia was largely defined by\nUber’s decision to keep its offering the same across the globe. Grab offered\nusers a  familiar service that fits with their existing needs and wants, whereas\nUber tried to push what worked in the west onto users in the east.\n\nKnow-your-customer isn’t just a compliance standard. It is a fundamental tenet\nof good business.\n\nThe Expansion Race in Southeast Asia\nGrab currently operates in:\n\n * Malaysia (as of June 2012)\n * The Philippines (as of July 2013)\n * Singapore (as of October 2013)\n * Thailand (as of October 2013)\n * Indonesia (as of June 2014),\n * Vietnam (as of February 2014)\n * Myanmar (as of March 2017).\n * Cambodia (as of December 2017)\n\nComparing launch dates in new markets for Grab and Gojek, Grab comes out ahead\nin all markets. Even in Gojek’s native Indonesia, where Gojek launched as an\nojek call center in 2010, Grab beat them to market with a mobile app in\nIndonesia.\n\nThis puts Gojek’s 2015 move very clear to me. From my Gojek post:\n\n> When Gojek launched their app in 2015, they had drawn inspiration from Uber and\nLyft, but made the conscious effort to launch with more than just ridesharing.\nThey did not believe ridesharing alone could create a strong enough network\neffect for the business. They launched with motorbike ridesharing, delivery\n(Go-Food), and shopping (Go-Send). My sense of what was going on in the\nbackground here was that Gojek’s main competitor, Grab launched in 2012 and by\n2014, was beginning to expand ridesharing into Indonesia. Gojek did not want to\nlose their home market and wanted to give users multiple reasons to use their\napp so they launched with several applications for users whereas, at this point,\nGrab was only ridesharing.\nLaunch dates in SEA countries:\n\nIn Indonesia, Grab is competing against native Gojek. To show how much they want\nto win Indonesia, in 2019, Grab committed to investing $2 billion into its\nIndonesia expansion. This is on top of $1 billion that Grab is said to have\nalready invested into Indonesia. To make this expansion, they have the support\nof their investor and kingmaker, Masayoshi Son, who said, “Indonesia’s\ntechnology sector has huge potential. I’m very happy to be investing US$2\nbillion into the future of Indonesia through Grab.”\n\nIn Indonesia, both Gojek and Grab use green as their uniform color, which can be\nconfusing.\n\nThe Straussian Reading of Business and Product\nOne thing I took away while re-reading my post was that so much of launching a\nsuccessful product is deciphering what it is that people really want. Borrowing\nan ELI5 definition\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/60823b/eli5what_does_tyler_cowen_mean_when_he_says/] \nof “Straussian” the teams refers to a situation where “there's a hidden meaning\nin the text, that you may need some background information on the author and\nsubject to understand it.” This relates to my earlier points on “KYC a core\ntenet of business” and the value of localism, but let’s take it a step further.\nThe users often don’t tell you what they want directly, sometimes you need to\ninfer.\n\nI listened to a podcast [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUxWKwSrCIk] recently\nwith the most-engaging Rory Sutherland [https://twitter.com/rorysutherland] \nwhere he said something to the effect of\n[https://evonomics.com/the-real-power-of-free-markets-not-efficiency-but-innovation-and-dumb-luck/]\n, “Most people think they own a dishwasher to clean dishes. But perhaps the\ngreatest value you get from owning a dishwasher is that it gives you somewhere\nto keep dirty dishes out of sight.”\n\nThe same could be said of many of Grab’s products:\n\n * Grab founders realized that what the driver’s really needed for this to work\n   was smartphones. Rather than Gojek who dealt with existing infrastructure and\n   operated as a call center for years, Grab got to the root of the problem and\n   gave all drivers a smartphone.\n * Reading about taxis in Malaysia, it actually sounds like they had always been\n   pretty prevalent and relatively easy to hail, BUT they were very unsafe.\n   Grab’s initial feature set focused on safety (license plate tracking,\n   location tracking, etc.). At first (MyTeksi) Grab was solving for the problem\n   of safety more than they were the actual “hailing” of a ride.\n\nThen the quote I used earlier about GrabPay,\n\n> “If people have cash in a system and can’t get it out, they want to get it out,”\nThompson said. “If they have cash in a system and know they are able to get it\nout, that makes them relax, and they actually leave more money in the system.\nOur customers leave a lot in our wallet because they’re confident that they can\nget it out when they need it.”\nGrab realized that many people weren’t asking for digital payments, but they\nwould be very happy with an easier and cheaper way to move in and out of cash\n(the thing they actually wanted).\n\nThis serves me as a reminder that yes, it’s good to interview and talk to your\ncustomers, but it’s also important to understand their comments in the context\nof the larger environment. To watch their actions and see if they line up with\nthe behaviors you would expect given their comments and if not, deeply\ninvestigate the source of the dissonance.\n\nCool Random Stuff\nOne of my favorite stories\n[https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2157177/how-grabs-ceo-steered-it-garage-malaysia-southeast-asias-most-valuable-tech] \nI read about while writing this article was about when Anthony Tan went to the\nPhilippines to meet with a taxi fleet boss.\n\n> Midway through the negotiations, there was a loud thud. [Anthony] peered under\ntheir table and saw what looked like a machine gun on the floor.\n> “I was like, holy cow, I guess this negotiation is going in your favour!” It was\nonly later that Tan realised he had just sat across the table from one of the\narea’s biggest arms dealers.\nBusiness overseas is a lot different than business in America!!\n\nAnd to wrap this post up, a fun TikTok comparing Grab and Gojek:","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558899367-3cd83fb31ed8?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-11T18:53:56.000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-01T21:40:09.000Z","published_at":"2020-07-05T18:55:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Grab is a Singapore-headquartered Southeast Asian SuperApp. The company is best known for its ride-hailing services throughout Southeast Asia (SEA) but also offers dozens of other services including payments, delivery services, and a suite of financial products.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f0e39ad9cf04000397735e9","uuid":"235f1507-0af2-45f0-b66f-16330da2c0ac","title":"Switching to Ghost","slug":"switching-to-ghost","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org?lmref=AOjDNA\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/subscribe\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"__GHOST_URL__/tag/personal/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"__GHOST_URL__/tag/crypto/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"__GHOST_URL__/tag/east-meets-west/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://web.archive.org/web/20131215144152/http://john.onolan.org/project-ghost/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ghost.org/enterprise/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/the-dispatch-substack-1-million-revenue/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh/status/1220037767729577984?s=20\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://stratechery.com/2019/ghost-3-0-an-interview-with-ghost-ceo-john-onolan/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"After two free-trials, I finally decided to switch over to \"],[0,[0],1,\"Ghost(Pro)\"],[0,[],0,\".\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I used to run my blog/personal site on Tumblr (100% free), which was easy for posting and set-up, but was always a bit janky looking. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[1],1,\"Things Ghost does great: \"]]],[3,\"ul\",[[[0,[],0,\"The Ghost customer support is some of the best I've ever dealt with.

For\n   a Substack publication like The Dispatch that's doing more than $1m in\n   annual\n   revenue\n   [https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/the-dispatch-substack-1-million-revenue/],\n   assuming no special deals, they're paying substack $100k/year. And listen, I\n   think Substack is awesome\n   [https://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh/status/1220037767729577984?s=20], but\n   that take rate is tough to justify when something like Ghost exists. \n\nIf you're interested in learning more: \n\n * Interview with Ghost founder in Stratechery (link\n   [https://stratechery.com/2019/ghost-3-0-an-interview-with-ghost-ceo-john-onolan/]\n   )\n * Sign up for Ghost here [https://ghost.org?lmref=AOjDNA]","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1476283721796-dd935b062838?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-07-14T23:03:09.000Z","updated_at":"2020-07-20T04:28:21.000Z","published_at":"2020-07-14T23:39:59.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f0fc74b7d894500397de351","uuid":"6cd5696f-eecb-48df-b72b-a455a1f502db","title":"Other planetary humans","slug":"other-planetary-humans","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16690.The_Moon_is_a_Harsh_Mistress\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38102788-vagabonds\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/350.Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=cDrmdi92VR&rank=1\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I recently read:\"]]],[3,\"ul\",[[[0,[0],1,\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\"],[0,[],0,\" by Robert A.

A friend who I trust a lot\n   recommended it to me for clearer skin. I’ve never had serious acne, but I\n   have found that while using this (and also stopping my prior skin care\n   routine) that my skin has been clearer than ever before. \n * Modafinil - I use modalert 200mg\n   [https://modafinilxl.com/buy-modalert-online/], but there are a lot of\n   alternatives. I would definitely say DYOR on this one, but for long periods\n   of WFH focused work, I like to take modafinil early in the morning after a\n   cup of coffee. I do not take this daily.

Use Cloudflare. Cloudflare has started offering domain\nregistering services at no mark-up. Their domains are long-term cheaper than any\nof the popular services (GoDaddy, Name Cheap, Google Domains, etc.). \n\nA common tactic you will see from registrars like GoDaddy is to give you the\ndomain for a discount in year 1, but then 2-3x the actual price in year 2 and\nbeyond.\n\n\nFor example, thisisatesdomain123.com [http://thisisatesdomain123.com/] will cost\nyou $8.03/year on Cloudflare. On GoDaddy, the same domain will cost you $1 in\nyour first year and then 17.99/year in year two and beyond.\n\nCloudflare Pricing.

People with large audiences who are viewed as \"thought leaders\" in an industry tend to be well-connected and find it easier to come across new roles. This could take the form of having a popular newsletter, a large Twitter following, or many stars on Github. A software engineer who writes a newsletter about managing engineering teams might have a CEO who reads their work and in turn would jump at the chance to hire them as a manager. A frequent open-source contributor to a project would have an easy time being hired by a company that relies on that software package. </li><li>Cut your burn and move to a low cost of living geography.

It makes a lot of sense why Uber needs to cut back on salaries, but as I said earlier, Facebook doesn't have the same urgency to do so.

For most of the dinner, everyone focused on how blue-collar workers\nwould be impacted by robotics and automation. Naturally, there was lots of talk\nabout trucking being the #1 job in many states, how it was highly prone to\nautomation, and how we should have a UBI to protect our most vulnerable. \n\nNear the end, someone chimed in that it was low and mid-level white-collar\nworkers who were most at risk of technological disruption. This is a somewhat\nobvious, but often overlooked point. \n\nIs it easier to have a machine / “AI” (i.e., some software) replace your plumber\nor your paralegal? Your accountant or your construction worker? \n\nLet’s think about how a shift to full remote work will impact salaries\nspecifically for employees in the tech industry. \n\n2\n\nOutsourcing \"white collar\" jobs is not new. Tons of low-level \"white collar\"\njobs have been outsourced to save costs around routine tasks. As an example of\nwhat happens now for business-y roles, let's look at McKinsey and Company. \n\nMcKinsey (along with all other banks, consultancies, and accounting firms) \noutsources [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_IqCPs6u8Y] the bulk of its\nPowerPoint development to lower cost employees in India, Poland, and LatAm\n(Costa Rica and Bogota, Colombia). There is nothing wrong with this. While a\nmanager in the Bangalore office will make less than a new grad hire at\nMcKinsey's San Francisco office, they probably make more than most of their\nfriends and family. I bet it's a coveted job in their communities. \n\nIn Bangalore, it appears that McKinsey employs 1,500+ people in these kinds of\nroles. Here's a JD\n[https://www.mckinsey.com/careers/search-jobs/jobs/teamleader-visualgraphicsmedia-40920] \nfor a Team Leader in Bangalore. Per Glassdoor\n[https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/McKinsey-and-Company-Team-Leader-Bangalore-Salaries-EJI_IE2893.0,20_KO21,32_IL.33,42_IM1091.htm] \n(not perfect, of course), that team leader role, at the high end, pays ₹639k\n($8,528) annually. So about 1/10 of a new grad hire in San Francisco. \n\nSource: Glassdoor3\n\nWhile many business functions have been outsourced, there has been a strong\naversion to this within software engineering roles. \n\nThere are multiple reasons for this including (1) the most successful companies\nlike Google and Facebook are well known for big campuses where proximity is\nviewed as a key to success (2) investors don't want to / don't like funding\ncompanies where software isn't core. An example: \n\nSource: @paulg [https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1149331285090951168?s=20]So, if\nyou combine the sentiment from Paul Graham and the assumed wisdom from companies\nlike Google and FB, many companies felt that the best way to succeed was to have\nmany people working together in the same room/campus. \n\nAttitudes towards partially distributed or mostly non-HQ-based engineering were\nbeginning to change and will be accelerated by COVID. \n\nFor several years, competition for engineering talent in the Bay Area was making\nit harder and more expensive to hire engineers there. As a result, companies\nwere beginning to open HQ2, HQ3, HQ4 earlier and earlier. \n\nI believe Stripe (an influential Bay Area-based company) helped to make remote\nwork more acceptable by announcing that its fifth engineering hub would be \"\nRemote [https://stripe.com/blog/remote-hub]\". The success of companies like\nGitlab and Automattic along with their habit of 'open-sourcing' their remote\noperating processes also did a lot to make distributed teams more accepted. \n\nAs an anecdotal counter to Paul Graham's tweets, here's a short story of how\nGojek, Indonesia's most highly valued private technology company, built the\nearly versions of their product: \n\n> In April of 2015, Sequoia Capital made the introduction to Sidu Ponnappa, the\nfounder of C42 Engineering (“a boutique software product engineering firm based\nout of Bangalore, India”). He visited Indonesia on a business trip and was\nexcited by the opportunities in Southeast Asia. By August/September 2015, Gojek\nhad the entire staff of C42 and another outsourced engineering firm,\nCodeIgnition, working solely on Gojek, just as the app was beginning to explode\nin usage\n> A short while later in late 2015/early 2016, Gojek acquired both of the\noutsourced firms, forming the basis of their India engineering staff.  The\nfounders of both of those firms, Sidu Ponnappa and Ajey Gore would both join\nGojek and are still with the company today. This seems to be a very intentional\nstrategy for Gojek. To date, Gojek has acquired 3 Indian outsourced engineering\nfirms along with one Indian AI-recruiting startup. These acquisitions have been\nthe basis of their large Indian engineering offices. \nSource: Omitted text from my deep dive into Gojek [__GHOST_URL__/gojek/]\n\nThe \"value-add\" venture capital firm of the future might be the one that owns a\ndeveloper shop in India or Ukraine 🤪\n\n4\n\nIn this section, I'll outline some real examples and put number behind my\nclaims. \n\n4.1\n\nHere is a real anecdotal example. A friend of mine works at a 40-person startup\nin San Francisco where they've had trouble hiring a product manager. The product\nmanagers they wanted to hire asked for too much money and the one or two they\nhad been able to hire didn't work out. They wound up offering a \"long term\ncontract\" to a technical product manager in India with a master's degree from\none of the IITs [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology] \nand six years of experience. They pay him $20,000/year with no benefits and no\nequity. They said this person has been kick-ass and is one of the harder working\npeople on their team. They don't expect this person to go out and do customer\ninterviews, but this person does a great job working with engineers and has\nbrought every request from the CEO to life so far. \n\n4.2\n\nTo add some more color to this, let’s use GitLab’s salary calculator\n[https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/total-rewards/compensation/compensation-calculator/calculator/]\n.\n\nGitlab pays an \"expert\" Backend Engineer in a manager role in Mumbai, India\nbetween $76,815 - $82,174\n\nFor 3x as much, Gitlab could hire someone with similar credentials in San\nFrancisco. \n\nFor about 2.5x as much as the senior engineer in India, Gitlab could hire that\nperson in a lower cost American city like Phoenix, AZ. \n\nOh, and don't forget, if this hypothetical candidate lives in the United States,\nthey get all the benefits listed below. From the Gitlab site, it appears that if\nthey hired this person in India, they would not get these benefits (this is not\nat all a diss at GitLab. Just a matter-of-fact statement)\n\n4.3\n\nNow not all companies need to do this. For example, Facebook doesn't NEED to do\nthis. Facebook mints money and has a very high margin business. But there are a\nlot of companies that have tight margins where cutting salaries by an average of\n1/3 would do a lot for profitability and shareholders. The case in point is\nUber.\n\nSource: The Information\n[https://www.theinformation.com/articles/uber-ceo-wants-to-shift-more-engineering-jobs-to-india-sparking-internal-debate]\n, @amir [https://twitter.com/amir]\n5\n\nHow does one survive and thrive in this world?\n\n * Be in top % of what you do. A mid-level engineer at Google who whines about\n   cafeteria food might be susceptible to replacement, but Jeff Dean\n   [https://www.wired.com/story/googles-new-ai-head-is-so-smart-he-doesnt-need-ai/] \n   doesn't have anything to worry about\n * As Scott Adams has said, develop your talent stack\n   [https://www.scottadamssays.com/2016/11/28/the-trump-talent-stack/]. This\n   means, you don't have to be Jeff Dean (i.e., the top 1% at something), but\n   you can combine being better than average at several things. For example,\n   maybe you're an OK computer vision engineer and you also have a deep\n   knowledge of fish, you could be uniquely qualified for a job at e.g., \n   Aquabyte [http://www.aquabyte.ai/index.html]. \n * Have a strong personal brand. People with large audiences who are viewed as\n   \"thought leaders\" in an industry tend to be well-connected and find it easier\n   to come across new roles. This could take the form of having a popular\n   newsletter, a large Twitter following, or many stars on Github. A software\n   engineer who writes a newsletter about managing engineering teams might have\n   a CEO who reads their work and in turn would jump at the chance to hire them\n   as a manager. A frequent open-source contributor to a project would have an\n   easy time being hired by a company that relies on that software package. \n * Cut your burn and move to a low cost of living geography. Unlike the factory\n   worker that was put out of work, keyboard workers can move to lower CoL\n   geographies and take lower salaries while still living comfortably. It's much\n   easier to decrease your burn by 3x than to increase your net worth by 3x\n   [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/968236413501124608?s=20]. Instead of\n   paying $18,000/year\n   [https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/520-Geary-St-511-San-Francisco-CA-94102/2078345539_zpid/] \n   in rent in San Francisco for a cramped studio apartment in the worst\n   neighborhood, you could pay $6,000/year\n   [https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18084726?adults=1&location=Bangkok%2C%20Thailand&check_in=2020-10-01&check_out=2020-10-31&display_extensions%5B%5D=MONTHLY_STAYS&source_impression_id=p3_1597254772_U%2B%2BFStNXt19a8BZp] \n   for a luxury condo rental in Bangkok or a mortgage in the midwest. \n * Work at high margin company where this is less likely to happen? It makes a\n   lot of sense why Uber needs to cut back on salaries, but as I said earlier,\n   Facebook doesn't have the same urgency to do so. It might be the case that\n   big companies like Facebook just keep scooping up all the high-priced\n   California and New York-living engineering

WeChat <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/daily-active-user-of-messaging-app-wechat-exceeds-1-billion/\">has</a> more than 1 billion daily active users, putting it into the highest tier of social apps.

For example, if you are using WeChat outside of China and don’t have a Chinese bank account, a lot of features are not available to you.</em></p><p>In 1994, WeChat’s eventual creator, Zhāng Xiǎolóng (English name: Allen Zhang), finished his master’s degree in ‘telecommunications engineering’ at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.</p><p>By 1997, at 28-years old, Zhang as a lone software engineer created one of China’s earliest internet companies, Foxmail, which became China’s #1 free internet client. It gained about 5 million users which, in 1997, gave it a 33% market share in China.</p><p>In 2000, Boda China, an internet services company, acquired Foxmail for ~$1,500,000. Zhang became a Corporate VP at Boda, in charge of technology development.</p><p>By 2005, Foxmail has stalled out within Boda with users disappointed at the lack of updates coming from the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110823053147/http:/news.pconline.com.cn/hy/0503/577240.html\">product</a>. In March 2005, Boda was bought by Tencent or Boda sold Foxmail’s assets to Tencent, details are fuzzy. Either way, Allen Zhang wound up at Tencent.</p><p>This was during a period where Tencent was fiercely competing with Microsoft’s MSN and Hotmail to win email in China and the acquisition was seen as a way to strengthen Tencent’s existing QQ Mail offering.</p><p>After moving over to Tencent in 2005, Allen was made the head of Tencent’s Guangzhou R&amp;D center and eventually the head of QQ Mail. By 2008, his team had launched a completely revamped version of the QQ Mailbox that supported 2G attachments leading to it gaining in popularity. By March 2008, it was China’s most <a href=\"http://tech.163.com/14/0228/14/9M67OQ9100094ODU.html\">popular</a> email product.</p><p>But by 2010, Allen was <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=f9qKCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=/+zhang+email+to+pony+ma&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VLgrW9A6aI&amp;sig=ACfU3U1LxTD0JecqxiOVGEZLx8EVLmGHZw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiQ5diPytTpAhXJsJ4KHdwBBsoQ6AEwA3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=allen%20zhang%20email%20to%20pony%20ma&amp;f=false\">beginning</a> to get bored at Tencent.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5ce00b26-c7c9-4e97-bc26-a85f43d89da4_510x287.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A picture containing person, indoor, man, holding\n\nDescription automatically generated\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>(<a href=\"https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1610507\">Source</a>)</p><p>Then, on October 19, 2010, Kik Messenger was released on Android, iPhone, and Blackberry. Within 15 days, the app had been downloaded over 1 million times by users across the world. The value proposition of Kik was pretty simple: free text messaging. It’s hard to remember, but there was a time when you had to pay for text messages. Kik also had features that were very new at the time, including tracking when a message was sent, delivered, read, and when someone was typing, turning texting into real-time conversations.</p><p>This period was also the peak era of China copying foreign technology startups and bringing them to China. Within months of Kik’s rise, several Chinese messaging apps were built that copied Kik’s feature set, <a href=\"https://technode.com/2011/01/15/hey-shall-we-copy-the-idea-of-kik-messenger/\">including</a> apps such as Miliao/Mi Talk by Xiaomi.</p><p>Allen was excited by Kik’s fast rise. In October of 2010, Allen sent an email to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Huateng\">Pony Ma</a> (Tencent’s Founder and CEO) in the middle of the night expressing his interest in building a similar <a href=\"http://tech.163.com/14/0228/14/9M67OQ9100094ODU.html\">product</a>,</p><blockquote><em>One night, [Allen] was looking at Kik-like software, [and Allen] came up with an idea: the mobile Internet will have a new IM in the future, and this new IM is likely to pose a great threat to QQ. After thinking about it for an hour or two, he wrote an email to Tencent CEO Ma Huateng Pony, suggesting that Tencent do this. Pony quickly replied to the email expressing his agreement with this suggestion. Allen then suggested to Pony the Guangzhou R &amp; D department to undertake the development of this project. \"It's research-oriented anyway, no one knows what will happen in the future,\" Allen recalled. \"The starting point of the whole process is an hour or two. Suddenly I took the wrong nerve and wrote this email and it started.\"</em></blockquote><p>Pony Ma allegedly <a href=\"https://medium.com/@wenbinf/from-foxmail-to-the-super-app-old-china-tech-2-89e9b9cce06b\">responded</a> “马上就做” (Do it now)”</p><p>At this point, Tencent already had a massively successful <strong>desktop</strong> chat app, QQ, the #1 messaging app in China. QQ had a smartphone version, but it was a poor app and not Tencent’s top priority. A lot of the poor development of QQ Mobile was due to internal politics within Tencent. Mobile and desktop QQ were run by <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=ri5HDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=wechat+1.0+launch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FjEe2RQ6gy&amp;sig=ACfU3U0NUvjasAj6jTyamZ8FWEyhj6EsAg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjHp-T-zNTpAhXHr54KHdzXD1IQ6AEwCnoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wechat%201.0%20launch&amp;f=false\">different</a>, competing teams.</p><p>By November 2010, Allen Zhang had assembled a small team and they had a prototype of <strong>WeChat 1.0</strong>, which was largely a copy of Kik, with only text message functionality. WeChat launched in January 2011 to little fanfare.</p><p>In the background, while Kik was doing great in many parts of the world, it wasn’t gaining much market share in China.</p><p>There was a key insight that Kik and WeChat were missing that another startup, Talkbox, would discover. In an interview, Talkbox co-founder, Heatherm Huang tells a story about trying to get his Chinese parents to text with him and realizing that it was difficult for them to type using roman characters.</p><p>Many older generations in China, Korea, Japan, and other countries that use a symbol-based writing （你好）system never learned how to type using roman characters. The romanization of Chinese characters, called Pinyin (translating to “Spell Sound”) was only developed in the 1950s and wasn’t adopted as an international standard until the 1980s.</p><p>With this insight, Talkbox launched as a walkie-talkie-like application that allowed users to send voice messages between each other. Talkbox was launched a few days before WeChat and exploded in popularity in China.</p><p>By April 2011, Talkbox had over 1 million users and was the most popular social app in China and Southeast Asia. According to Talkbox’s co-founder, Pony Ma and Allen Zhang were active users of Talkbox having downloaded the app in its first weeks of launch.</p><p>The lackluster response to WeChat 1.0 led Tencent to believe the app would not be a success so they spoke to TalkBox about investment/acquisition. TalkBox turned down the offers.</p><p>Before starting TalkBox, Heatherm Huang <a href=\"https://technode.com/2018/08/22/talkbox-the-secret-history-of-wechat/\">recalls</a> seeing Pony Ma speak at a conference. Pony Ma shared that even though he had built China’s most successful messaging app (QQ), he was paranoid that his empire could still be destroyed. He hoped that if something was going to kill QQ that it be built by Tencent.</p><p>In the summer of 2011, <strong>WeChat Version 2.0</strong> launched copying Talkbox’s features to enable voice notes in the chat. With that, WeChat was off to the races.</p><p><strong>WeChat 2.1</strong> included the ability for users to connect to their QQ contacts and import them into their WeChat account. Given that QQ was already China’s largest desktop messaging app, this allowed WeChat to port over the strong social grid that Tencent had already built on QQ.</p><p>Between the summer and October of 2011, WeChat reached about 30 million users, whereas TalkBox stalled out around 10 million. At this point, Tencent put all their resources behind the WeChat team and began taking resources away from QQ. Heatherm, Talkbox co-founder, shares that during this time, Talkbox made the mistake of trying to fight a war with Tencent and WeChat in China rather than doubling down on their other markets throughout Southeast Asia.</p><p><strong>WeChat 2.5</strong> included some social features that helped to grow the app virally, including a “nearby” feature where users could see the avatars, names, and distances of people near to them. WeChat doubled down on these social connectivity features to continue to drive growth.</p><p><strong>WeChat 3.0 </strong>debuted in October of 2011 including “shake” and “drift bottle” features. Shake became a hugely popular feature whereby shaking your phone would match you with another WeChat user who was also shaking their phone at the same time. (This feature still exists. I just tried it out and matched with a woman 383 miles away.)</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95c31b57-4b44-493b-875a-f8c15f9963d4_439x950.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A close up of a logo\n\nDescription automatically generated\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Per <a href=\"https://qz.com/1613489/how-wechat-put-the-internet-in-chinas-hands/\">QZ</a>,</p><p><em>“WeChat really became popular because of its ability to connect strangers. In 2011, WeChat rolled out its “shake” feature, which allowed users to shake their phones and connect with other users who were doing the same at that moment. That’s an inspiration from QQ’s “<a href=\"https://qz.com/1651959/chinas-first-generation-dating-app-has-been-shut-down-by-tencent/\">drift bottle</a>,” a hookup feature allowing users to “throw” bottles containing either a text or voice message into a virtual ocean or “pick up” floating ones on QQ’s email service.”</em></p><p>I read an article that described Allen Zhang as a sort of poetically lonely person. In one interview, he spoke lovingly about these features that increased human connection, viewing WeChat as a way to bridge the loneliness that many people felt.</p><p>By the end of 2011 and with <a href=\"https://technode.com/2018/08/22/talkbox-the-secret-history-of-wechat/\">more than</a> 50,000,000 users, WeChat launched <strong>Version 3.5</strong>, which included a critical piece of WeChat infrastructure, the QR code (which I learned stands for “Quick Response Code”). In this launch, WeChat gave each account a unique QR code so that if you scan someone’s code, you could easily add them as your friend. Businesses could also register QR codes in which users could scan to view businesses’ catalogs and interact with their businesses in other ways.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8d3a5c5-e309-4a92-b092-03bbfe6ec130_554x422.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A screenshot of a computer\n\nDescription automatically generated\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Three months later on March 29, 2012, 14 months -- or 433 days --  after V1.0 launch, WeChat <a href=\"http://tech.163.com/14/0228/14/9M67OQ9100094ODU.html\">crossed</a> 100,000,000 users. For comparison, of what it took <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/01/20/the-social-media-platforms-that-hit-100-million-us.aspx\">other</a> top social apps to reach 100M users:</p><ul><li>Instagram: 26 months</li><li>Myspace: 36 months</li><li>Snapchat: 44 months</li><li>Facebook: 52 months</li><li>Twitter: 65 months</li></ul><p>WeChat’s next big release, <strong>Version 4.0</strong> added “<strong>Moments</strong>” and birthed its English name “WeChat”. At this point, Weixin (pronounced approximately “way-shin”) had 100 million users, mostly in China, and the company decided that to open up to a more global audience, it needed an English name. Thus, “WeChat” was born.</p><p>Some context on <strong>Moments</strong>: In the background of the development of WeChat, Tencent had been fighting another war against <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo\">Sina Weibo</a>. Sina Corporation’s Weibo (which means “microblog”) is a Twitter-like product that allows users to post short tweets/microblogs (big oversimplification). By leveraging their QQ social graph, Tencent was able to amass a large user base for its Weibo product which they launched 8 months after Sina’s launch. Ultimately Tencent fell short. In a 2012 earnings report, Tencent said, <em>“As the slow pace of Chinese Weibo user growth, we are seeking an integral point for Tencent Weibo and WeChat, so as to manifest our characteristics”</em></p><p>Thus, I believe <em>Moments</em> was built largely because Tencent failed to create their own killer Weibo app. (This wound up being a great failure)</p><p>Moments is a social tab within the WeChat app built around the principle that \"my friend's friend is not my friend\". In practice, this means that if I post a photo or status update on my Moment’s feed, only <em>my friends</em> can see, like, and comment on my Moment.</p><p>There also isn’t a unique link for Moments (i.e. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh\">https://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh</a> is my Twitter, but there is no WeChat.com/moments/ryanrodenbaugh).</p><p>Here are some of my Moments and what they look like in the latest version of WeChat:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd1e6ecf-d051-4ca6-9485-ded6a4c1c3c9_1464x1246.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>The one on the left shows you what the “likes” look like, whereas the one on the right gives a better look at the comment functionality. In the photo on the right, the person who commented “LMAO” is not friends with any of my other WeChat friends so no one besides me can see her comments or the fact that she liked my photo. In the photo on the left, the woman who commented “wow” shares a bunch of mutual friends with me so all of those mutual friends can see her comment (how nice of her!!).</p><p>To make a western comparison, I would describe Moments as a cross between Twitter and Instagram. The scrolling experience on Moments feels like scrolling Instagram where I am only seeing the content of people I follow (i.e., no RTs). Also, the commenting and liking features look more like Instagram. The content on the feed feels more like Twitter though where it is a mix of pure text, articles with commentary, and photos. The one caveat is that, in general, the content I see from my friends on Moments tends to be more personal (photos of them with family, at a dinner, of their cat) than what my friends post on Twitter.</p><p>In May of 2013, WeChat introduced <strong>Version 5.0</strong>, which was focused on B2C offerings and monetization. WeChat <a href=\"https://tech.qq.com/a/20130607/022793.htm\">debuted</a> official/public accounts, games, an updated QR code, and payments (!!).</p><p>With more than 300 million users, WeChat still did not have a firm monetization strategy. Games were their first approach. They added 11 games (games are Tencent’s bread and butter) into the WeChat app. The games allowed for in-app ‘virtual currency’ purchasing.</p><p>From early on, WeChat was a fan of working with partners and splitting revenue when possible. Two of the eleven games came from developers other than Tencent and had a revenue share agreement included. Around this time, WeChat also added a “sticker shop” where external designers could receive a cut of revenues that came from selling their digital products. Designers’ split ranged from 40-70% of revenues <a href=\"https://technode.com/2013/10/21/tencent-to-share-emoticon-sales-with-third-party-designers/\">depending</a> on how much was sold.</p><p>This was the first(?) instance where WeChat where users were able to link their bank account to “WeChat Payments” enabling in-app purchasing for games and digital goods.</p><p>Version 5.0 also saw an improved QR code that included “scan to translate”, the ability to scan barcodes and then place online orders for the product, and the ability to scan QR codes to make payments.</p><p>The other update in V5.0 was the release of<strong> official/public accounts</strong>. These were blog-like official accounts for brands and influencers with a lot of functionality for businesses, brands, and influencers to interact with consumers. Some examples that were published at the time included:</p><ul><li>China Southern Airlines: Allowing users to check the weather forecast, interactive mileage check, and membership display</li><li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130708115711/http:/technode.com/2013/07/05/nine-ways-to-do-business-with-wechat-official-accounts-part-ii/\">Best Express</a>: Was a shipping and logistics company that via WeChat public accounts could allow users to “realize the functions of package tracking, online-store searching, service assessment, reservation, and complaints “</li><li><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130624161223/http:/technode.com/2013/06/18/china-merchants-bank-tries-deeper-integration-with-wechat/\">China Merchant Bank</a>: Was a custom integration by WeChat allowing users to check their bills, credit limits, transaction records, and more. It’s highlighted in the media coverage that previously this type of information would have been sent to users via SMS.</li></ul><p>It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when WeChat became a “Super App”, but this feels like a good point to consider. On my phone right now, I have separate airline apps, package tracking apps, and banking apps. If I was Chinese/living in China, I would not need those. These “official accounts” would evolve into something much bigger, but this is the first point at which brands could build their business (and customer touchpoints) on top of WeChat.</p><p>Around this time, WeChat also began partnering with physical businesses to offer online store functionality where in-person businesses could set up a digital storefront and sell goods. Their <a href=\"http://www.ebrun.com/20130910/81509.shtml\">first</a> pilot was with a Chinese department store. They also tried something with McDonald's where you could buy a coupon voucher within WeChat and then show the QR code to your McDonalds Cashier to redeem the offer.</p><p>By Q3 2013, WeChat <a href=\"https://technode.com/2013/10/24/wechat-reportedly-surpassed-600-million-users/\">had</a> more than 600 million registered accounts with more than 100 million overseas users and 271.9 million monthly active users. For perspective, in February of that same year, they had 300 million registered users.</p><p>In WeChat’s December 2013 update, <strong>Version 5.1 </strong>focused on payments.</p><p>In addition to in-app game purchases, users <a href=\"https://technode.com/2013/12/24/tech-in-china-2013-wechat-is-everything/\">were</a> able to use WeChat pay for phone bills, digital lottery tickets, shopping on Tencent’s online retailer Yixun, purchases at a <a href=\"http://ubox.cn/\">Ubox</a> vending machine, or Haidilao, the most famous hotpot chain restaurant in China.</p><p>WeChat also upgraded the public accounts to have “services accounts”. These were brand focused accounts where brands could message their users directly (think of it as a CRM). Service accounts were limited to only sending one bulk push marketing message per month to reduce users feeling cluttered or <a href=\"https://jingdaily.com/wechat-5-0-how-brands-can-gain-big-from-powerful-new-features/\">spammed</a>. This inclination to limit messages from brands stems from Allen’s deep love of <em>product</em> and his insight that brands spamming users would ruin users’ relationship with the WeChat product.</p><p>WeChat saw the importance of payments and employed some good old growth hacking techniques to get more users to connect WeChat to their bank accounts.</p><p>In December 2013, WeChat allowed users to make group chats of 100 people <strong>but</strong> each user could only be the owner of one 100-person group. To <a href=\"https://technode.com/2013/12/18/wechat-5-1-version/\">promote</a> WeChat Pay adoption, WeChat allowed users to own another two 100-person groups after having signed up for WeChat Pay and an additional fourth group if the user used WeChat Pay. This was notably different than how Tencent’s QQ desktop messenger worked where users would have had to have paid for a premium subscription if they wanted to have large group chats.</p><p>WeChat also added the ability for users to have default shipping addresses, making shipments (and the payment process) more seamless.</p><p>Back in the Spring of 2013, Tencent made a $15 million-dollar investment in the then-nascent Chinese ride-hailing app, Didi, buying a 20% stake in the company. On January 2, 2014, they invested another $30 million into Didi as a part of a $100 million round (today, Didi is valued at ~$50-60 billion).</p><p>A few days after their second investment in Didi in January of 2014, WeChat and Didi announced a partnership where on the WeChat Pay page, you could directly “order a taxi” using Didi’s service. As a promotion, users who paid with WeChat Pay had a 10 Yuan (~$1-2) subsidy applied to their rides. For WeChat, this gave users a great reason to set up their WeChat Pay given that Didi had a ~60% market share in Chinese ride-hailing at the time. For Didi, this gave them more direct access to WeChat’s hundreds of millions of monthly active <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/china-hail-taxi-pay-driver-wechat\">users</a>. The promotion was a big win, with some large cities like Wuhan (a population of ~11 million) seeing <a href=\"https://www.36kr.com/p/1641825402881\">60%</a> of DiDi users switch over to WeChat Pay.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e0e498b-a614-44a4-b926-5611fd6f9cc6_720x639.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"A screenshot of a cell phone\n\nDescription automatically generated\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>During the Chinese New Year (late January) it is a tradition for family members to give each other 红包 🧧 (Hong Bao, Red Envelopes) with a little bit of money inside.</p><p>During the 2014 CNY celebration, WeChat enabled users to send hóngbāo to their WeChat friends.

Funny enough, WeChat Pay’s main competitor, Alipay (by Alibaba) launched a similar feature two years earlier, but it never took off the way WeChat’s feature did. Alibaba founder Jack Ma <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money\">called it</a> a “Pearl Harbor moment” for his company.</p><p>Red envelopes also had a cultural subtlety that made them very attractive. Chinese people enjoy gaming and gambling. Red Envelopes built both of those aspects into the product. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money\">For example</a>, when you send an envelope,</p><blockquote><em>“You can put $5 in a red envelope and [send it to a group chat with 5 people and] set it to disburse equally, so each friend gets $1. Alternatively, you could stipulate that the first two people to tap will get all the money in equal portions—$2.50 each—or that the first two people get a random cut, maybe $1 for one person and $4 for the other. The result is that any time a red envelope appears, people scramble to tap on it as fast as possible”</em></blockquote><p>During the 2015 Lunar New Year, ~1 billion red envelopes were sent, and by the 2016 Lunar New Year, WeChat logged ~8 billion Red Envelopes sent.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bbdf52d-3d92-45b2-a2d5-60d7d57dd7c8_640x360.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Chart from TheAtlas.com\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Source: <a href=\"https://qz.com/613384/over-8-billion-red-envelopes-were-sent-over-wechat-during-chinese-new-year/\">QZ</a></p><p>Like how Tencent had a popular messaging app (QQ) before WeChat, they also had a payments app (“TenPay”) before WeChat Pay. TenPay was always smaller than Alipay, but with the penetration of WeChat’s users and promotions via WeChat Pay, WeChat Pay was able to compete against Alipay in a way that “TenPay” was not. (FWIW, TenPay still exists and sometimes analysts will use TenPay interchangeably with “WeChat Pay” since I think it is technically the same infrastructure/digital banking license)</p><p>In 2014, WeChat upgraded their services pages to allow brands to set up stores within the WeChat app (originally called “WeChat Little Store”). Consider these like mini-Shopify-Esque pages within the WeChat app. Stores could upload and manage items, show inventory, receive payment (via WeChat Pay), and ship products to users. This was around the same time that Tencent gave up on some of their e-commerce ambitions and secede to JD.com, taking a large ownership stake in JD in the process.</p><p>Commerce is uniquely smooth within WeChat because payments are so deeply integrated into the app. These “WeChat Little Stores” did a lot to turn WeChat into a commerce search engine. Rather than e.g., going to Baidu and searching “Nike” and then going to their site, putting in payment info, shipping info, and making a purchase, you can just search Nike store on WeChat and payments and shipping info are also integrated. It’s a storefront built on top of a payments app, rather than a payment experience build into a website.</p><p>By June 2014, SMS texting was basically declared DEAD in China. It was <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/china-has-700-million-mobile-internet-users-crushing-sms-to-average-40-per-month\">reported</a> at the time that the average Chinese person sent about 1 text/day in a period when China added 27 million new phone subscribers.</p><p>In July 2014, Tech in Asia published an <a href=\"http://expatadvisorscommunity.com.au/updates/story-of-zhang-xiaolong-founder-of-wechat/\">article</a> foreshadowing the growing trend in China of entrepreneurs choosing to build their apps solely on WeChat and not bothering with iOS and Android applications. Though there are tradeoffs to not having your own app, one founder said, “With 400 million active WeChat users, getting access to them outweighs any cons.”</p><p>One year after adding payments, WeChat was already persuading founders to build their applications solely on their platform.</p><p>Very similar to Shopify “arming the rebels”, WeChat saw that it was expensive for retailers to get noticed on big e-commerce platforms in China like JD, Taobao, etc. WeChat gave merchants a direct way to sell to their consumers.</p><p>In September 2014, WeChat Pay added the massive feature of allowing users to pay for in-store purchases with QR codes. Initially, this feature was <a href=\"https://www.pingwest.com/a/36782\">only</a> supported by large merchants (e.g., Dairy Queen), but in 2020, virtually every single vendor in China from taxis to street vendors to Gucci stores support QR payments via WeChat Pay (and AliPay, which came to market with this QR code feature a few years before WeChat Pay).</p><p>By Q4 of 2014, WeChat <a href=\"https://fintechranking.com/2015/03/18/wechat-now-has-500-million-monthly-active-users/\">crossed</a> 500 million global monthly active users, up from 355 million in Q4’13.</p><p>WeChat also continued to push their monetization by allowing ads to show in the “Moments” feed. Anecdotally, as an active scroller of “Moments,” the ads have never once felt intrusive or annoying.</p><p>Around 2015, WeChat implemented what I found to be one of their coolest features and it is a testament to what you can do when you have deeply integrated payments. Public accounts were able to add a “tipping” feature or put a paywall in front of their content. Online tipping is a huge industry in China with lots of streamers and content creators monetizing their content this way. With two clicks, you can tip content creators on WeChat. Easy as that. By 2017, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=jONiDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=tipping+creators+on+wechat+2016&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0mEp4FY26H&amp;sig=ACfU3U0Ie2Oit6-S9iV6-GVQKGBQVHe2Lw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjdjJOrz9zpAhXYJjQIHfCDA3QQ6AEwCHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tipping%20creators%20on%20wechat%202016&amp;f=false\">about</a> 11% of WeChat users (that’s a lot of people!) had used the function.

At first, the offering included all of WeChat’s core features (chat, voice messaging, send location, etc.) with the addition of work-related features such as requesting time off.</p><p>I believe one of the reasons they did this was that many people were already using WeChat for work, but because they now had so many work-related chats and contacts, people might have started feeling hesitant posting to Moments. A personal anecdote to support this… I made a WeChat account because I was doing a lot of business with people in China. For me, WeChat was first a business app, but over time as I made more and more Chinese friends, I also had a lot of personal relations on the app. I’ve always posted personal and funny things on my Moments (as you saw above), but I had a lot of friends who said that because they had so many work friends on their personal account, they posted less on their Moments. On that note, it’s also not uncommon for people to have multiple WeChat accounts (one for family and close friends and one for work-related contacts)</p><p>As of February 2020, 60 million users across 2.5 million organizations were using WeChat Work (all in China, btw). It was <a href=\"https://www.pingwest.com/a/36782\">reported</a> that 80% of China’s Fortune 500 and 81% of the top retail organizations in China used WeChat Work (wow!). They’ve also added all the other features you’d come to expect from an offering of this kind (file sharing, expense account management, etc.)</p><p>For comparison, Microsoft Teams had 75 million daily active users (32 million pre-COVID) and Slack’s last public number in October 2019 was 12 million DAU.</p><p>Throughout the <strong>6.0 Version</strong> upgrades of the WeChat core app, the updates were largely nice to have features e.g., group video calls, WeRun (a Strava-like product), etc.</p><p>One of WeChat’s biggest product additions came in early 2017 with the formal introduction of “mini-programs”. By this time WeChat <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/wechat-mini-programs/\">had</a> 846 million monthly active users and 768 million daily active users.</p><p>Mini-programs are “light apps” (though Apple wouldn’t let WeChat call them “apps”) that lived inside of the WeChat application. While some of the apps are from independent companies (e.g., a startup that makes a camera filter app), many of them are created by brands who want more ways to interact with customers. <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/wechat-mini-programs-launch\">For example</a>, Nike has a mini-program that looks like a full-fledged store, McDonald’s has one for coupons, movie theaters have mini-programs to buy tickets, and Didi has one to get a ride.</p><p>One year after launch in January 2018, there <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/wechat-strategy/chinas-wechat-plans-to-resurrect-tipping-button-after-agreement-with-apple-idUSL3N1PA1UJ\">were</a> 580,000 mini-programs on WeChat with 170 million daily active users. By the end of 2018, mini-programs had 600 million monthly active users and it seems about 200 million were daily active users.</p><p>In 2019, mini-programs weren’t just appealing to big brands like Nike, but also to the long tail of stores, “Niche apps within WeChat, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-11/tencent-s-mini-programs-could-open-up-wechat-for-business-use?sref=hyzbRjRU\">such as</a> those used by a parent-teacher group or neighborhood grocery store, accounted more than half of total Mini Programs traffic.”</p><p>You could think of it like, in the US, we have <a href=\"https://slicelife.com/\">Slice</a> so that pizza store owners can have a digital presence with delivery and <a href=\"https://joe.coffee/\">Joe.Coffee</a> for coffee shop owners to offer a mobile experience… but in China, every single physical store can have a digital presence through a Mini-Program. That analogy isn’t perfect, but it approximately frames the situation.</p><p>Something that sets WeChat mini-programs apart from regular apps or foreign equivalents is that by default, it is integrated with all other parts of the WeChat ecosystem: payments, live streaming/video, ability to interact with offline QR codes, geo-location, social connections, notifications, and all the other WeChat features. As a Tencent executive <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-11/tencent-s-mini-programs-could-open-up-wechat-for-business-use?sref=hyzbRjRU\">said</a> at a conference, <strong>“Just build a good Mini Program, and we’ll do the rest.”</strong></p><p>Tencent shared in its 2019 annual report that the number of daily transactions within mini-programs doubled YoY and that the total 2019 transaction volume exceeded RMB 800 billion ($112 billion).</p><p>Most WeChat programs fall into three overarching buckets, games, e-commerce, and lifestyle (which admittedly is a catch-all for everything from ride-hailing to cleaning services). Some examples of the diversity of WeChat programs are:</p><ul><li>Tencent’s video app where you can watch full-length TV shows like Game of Thrones</li><li>Chinese to English translation programs</li><li>Bike-sharing programs</li><li>Audio tourism guides for major cities</li><li>And games, lots and lots of games!</li></ul><p>One of the reasons Baidu (“Google of China”) has dreaded WeChat and mini-programs so much is that mini-programs have strong SEO, leading a lot of Chinese people to start their searches in mini-programs. For example, if you wanted to buy new running shoes, you might start that search in WeChat mini-programs rather than Baidu. This is a partial explanation for why Baidu stock is down 50% from its all-time high.</p><p>WeChat Launched 6.0 in late 2014 and then took about 4 years before launching 7.0 in <a href=\"https://blog.wechat.com/2019/01/18/whats-new-in-wechat-7-0-the-biggest-upgrade-in-four-years/\">January</a> of 2019. In that intervening period, WeChat continued to grow at an incredible rate across it’s messaging features, payment features, mini-programs, etc. but they did not add many <em>new features</em> during that time. There were few updates to Version 7.0, which speaks to more of Allen’s product principles of keeping things simple and not changing too fast on users.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion-to-part-1-\"><strong><strong>Conclusion (to Part 1)</strong></strong></h2><p>I remember reading the book “<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/885937.House_Of_Lies\">House of Lies</a>” about management consulting where a non-McKinsey consultant is feeling envious of McKinsey and is trying to get McKinsey out of his mind.

Amazon? Safari?\nWeChat (Wēixìn/微信), developed by the Chinese internet giant, Tencent, is a\nSuperApp with origins as a messaging app. Today, WeChat contains messaging,\nsocial features, payments, travel booking, virtual doctors, and so much more.\n\nWeChat is one of the most used applications in the world. WeChat has\n[https://www.zdnet.com/article/daily-active-user-of-messaging-app-wechat-exceeds-1-billion/] \nmore than 1 billion daily active users, putting it into the highest tier of\nsocial apps. For a social app, WeChat’s active user count is only surpassed by\nFacebook.com, WhatsApp, Facebook messenger, and YouTube.\n\n(If you’ve ever opened the WeChat app, you’ve seen this image)\n\nHistory\n\n*Note… I use Weixin as WeChat throughout this post, but it’s worth noting there\nis some difference. For example, if you are using WeChat outside of China and\ndon’t have a Chinese bank account, a lot of features are not available to you.\n\nIn 1994, WeChat’s eventual creator, Zhāng Xiǎolóng (English name: Allen Zhang),\nfinished his master’s degree in ‘telecommunications engineering’ at Huazhong\nUniversity of Science and Technology.\n\nBy 1997, at 28-years old, Zhang as a lone software engineer created one of\nChina’s earliest internet companies, Foxmail, which became China’s #1 free\ninternet client. It gained about 5 million users which, in 1997, gave it a 33%\nmarket share in China.\n\nIn 2000, Boda China, an internet services company, acquired Foxmail for\n~$1,500,000. Zhang became a Corporate VP at Boda, in charge of technology\ndevelopment.\n\nBy 2005, Foxmail has stalled out within Boda with users disappointed at the lack\nof updates coming from the product\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20110823053147/http:/news.pconline.com.cn/hy/0503/577240.html]\n. In March 2005, Boda was bought by Tencent or Boda sold Foxmail’s assets to\nTencent, details are fuzzy. Either way, Allen Zhang wound up at Tencent.\n\nThis was during a period where Tencent was fiercely competing with Microsoft’s\nMSN and Hotmail to win email in China and the acquisition was seen as a way to\nstrengthen Tencent’s existing QQ Mail offering.\n\nAfter moving over to Tencent in 2005, Allen was made the head of Tencent’s\nGuangzhou R&D center and eventually the head of QQ Mail. By 2008, his team had\nlaunched a completely revamped version of the QQ Mailbox that supported 2G\nattachments leading to it gaining in popularity. By March 2008, it was China’s\nmost popular [http://tech.163.com/14/0228/14/9M67OQ9100094ODU.html] email\nproduct.\n\nBut by 2010, Allen was beginning\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=f9qKCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=/+zhang+email+to+pony+ma&source=bl&ots=VLgrW9A6aI&sig=ACfU3U1LxTD0JecqxiOVGEZLx8EVLmGHZw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQ5diPytTpAhXJsJ4KHdwBBsoQ6AEwA3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=allen%20zhang%20email%20to%20pony%20ma&f=false] \nto get bored at Tencent.\n\n(Source [https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1610507])\n\nThen, on October 19, 2010, Kik Messenger was released on Android, iPhone, and\nBlackberry. Within 15 days, the app had been downloaded over 1 million times by\nusers across the world. The value proposition of Kik was pretty simple: free\ntext messaging. It’s hard to remember, but there was a time when you had to pay\nfor text messages. Kik also had features that were very new at the time,\nincluding tracking when a message was sent, delivered, read, and when someone\nwas typing, turning texting into real-time conversations.\n\nThis period was also the peak era of China copying foreign technology startups\nand bringing them to China. Within months of Kik’s rise, several Chinese\nmessaging apps were built that copied Kik’s feature set, including\n[https://technode.com/2011/01/15/hey-shall-we-copy-the-idea-of-kik-messenger/] \napps such as Miliao/Mi Talk by Xiaomi.\n\nAllen was excited by Kik’s fast rise. In October of 2010, Allen sent an email to \nPony Ma [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Huateng] (Tencent’s Founder and CEO)\nin the middle of the night expressing his interest in building a similar product\n[http://tech.163.com/14/0228/14/9M67OQ9100094ODU.html],\n\n> One night, [Allen] was looking at Kik-like software, [and Allen] came up with an\nidea: the mobile Internet will have a new IM in the future, and this new IM is\nlikely to pose a great threat to QQ. After thinking about it for an hour or two,\nhe wrote an email to Tencent CEO Ma Huateng Pony, suggesting that Tencent do\nthis. Pony quickly replied to the email expressing his agreement with this\nsuggestion. Allen then suggested to Pony the Guangzhou R & D department to\nundertake the development of this project. \"It's research-oriented anyway, no\none knows what will happen in the future,\" Allen recalled. \"The starting point\nof the whole process is an hour or two. Suddenly I took the wrong nerve and\nwrote this email and it started.\"\nPony Ma allegedly responded\n[https://medium.com/@wenbinf/from-foxmail-to-the-super-app-old-china-tech-2-89e9b9cce06b] \n“马上就做” (Do it now)”\n\nAt this point, Tencent already had a massively successful desktop chat app, QQ,\nthe #1 messaging app in China. QQ had a smartphone version, but it was a poor\napp and not Tencent’s top priority. A lot of the poor development of QQ Mobile\nwas due to internal politics within Tencent. Mobile and desktop QQ were run by \ndifferent\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=ri5HDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=wechat+1.0+launch&source=bl&ots=FjEe2RQ6gy&sig=ACfU3U0NUvjasAj6jTyamZ8FWEyhj6EsAg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjHp-T-zNTpAhXHr54KHdzXD1IQ6AEwCnoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=wechat%201.0%20launch&f=false]\n, competing teams.\n\nBy November 2010, Allen Zhang had assembled a small team and they had a\nprototype of WeChat 1.0, which was largely a copy of Kik, with only text message\nfunctionality. WeChat launched in January 2011 to little fanfare.\n\nIn the background, while Kik was doing great in many parts of the world, it\nwasn’t gaining much market share in China.\n\nThere was a key insight that Kik and WeChat were missing that another startup,\nTalkbox, would discover. In an interview, Talkbox co-founder, Heatherm Huang\ntells a story about trying to get his Chinese parents to text with him and\nrealizing that it was difficult for them to type using roman characters.\n\nMany older generations in China, Korea, Japan, and other countries that use a\nsymbol-based writing （你好）system never learned how to type using roman\ncharacters. The romanization of Chinese characters, called Pinyin (translating\nto “Spell Sound”) was only developed in the 1950s and wasn’t adopted as an\ninternational standard until the 1980s.\n\nWith this insight, Talkbox launched as a walkie-talkie-like application that\nallowed users to send voice messages between each other. Talkbox was launched a\nfew days before WeChat and exploded in popularity in China.\n\nBy April 2011, Talkbox had over 1 million users and was the most popular social\napp in China and Southeast Asia. According to Talkbox’s co-founder, Pony Ma and\nAllen Zhang were active users of Talkbox having downloaded the app in its first\nweeks of launch.\n\nThe lackluster response to WeChat 1.0 led Tencent to believe the app would not\nbe a success so they spoke to TalkBox about investment/acquisition. TalkBox\nturned down the offers.\n\nBefore starting TalkBox, Heatherm Huang recalls\n[https://technode.com/2018/08/22/talkbox-the-secret-history-of-wechat/] seeing\nPony Ma speak at a conference. Pony Ma shared that even though he had built\nChina’s most successful messaging app (QQ), he was paranoid that his empire\ncould still be destroyed. He hoped that if something was going to kill QQ that\nit be built by Tencent.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, WeChat Version 2.0 launched copying Talkbox’s features to\nenable voice notes in the chat. With that, WeChat was off to the races.\n\nWeChat 2.1 included the ability for users to connect to their QQ contacts and\nimport them into their WeChat account. Given that QQ was already China’s largest\ndesktop messaging app, this allowed WeChat to port over the strong social grid\nthat Tencent had already built on QQ.\n\nBetween the summer and October of 2011, WeChat reached about 30 million users,\nwhereas TalkBox stalled out around 10 million. At this point, Tencent put all\ntheir resources behind the WeChat team and began taking resources away from QQ.\nHeatherm, Talkbox co-founder, shares that during this time, Talkbox made the\nmistake of trying to fight a war with Tencent and WeChat in China rather than\ndoubling down on their other markets throughout Southeast Asia.\n\nWeChat 2.5 included some social features that helped to grow the app virally,\nincluding a “nearby” feature where users could see the avatars, names, and\ndistances of people near to them. WeChat doubled down on these social\nconnectivity features to continue to drive growth.\n\nWeChat 3.0 debuted in October of 2011 including “shake” and “drift bottle”\nfeatures. Shake became a hugely popular feature whereby shaking your phone would\nmatch you with another WeChat user who was also shaking their phone at the same\ntime. (This feature still exists. I just tried it out and matched with a woman\n383 miles away.)\n\nPer QZ [https://qz.com/1613489/how-wechat-put-the-internet-in-chinas-hands/],\n\n“WeChat really became popular because of its ability to connect strangers. In\n2011, WeChat rolled out its “shake” feature, which allowed users to shake their\nphones and connect with other users who were doing the same at that moment.\nThat’s an inspiration from QQ’s “drift bottle\n[https://qz.com/1651959/chinas-first-generation-dating-app-has-been-shut-down-by-tencent/]\n,” a hookup feature allowing users to “throw” bottles containing either a text\nor voice message into a virtual ocean or “pick up” floating ones on QQ’s email\nservice.”\n\nI read an article that described Allen Zhang as a sort of poetically lonely\nperson. In one interview, he spoke lovingly about these features that increased\nhuman connection, viewing WeChat as a way to bridge the loneliness that many\npeople felt.\n\nBy the end of 2011 and with more than\n[https://technode.com/2018/08/22/talkbox-the-secret-history-of-wechat/] \n50,000,000 users, WeChat launched Version 3.5, which included a critical piece\nof WeChat infrastructure, the QR code (which I learned stands for “Quick\nResponse Code”). In this launch, WeChat gave each account a unique QR code so\nthat if you scan someone’s code, you could easily add them as your friend.\nBusinesses could also register QR codes in which users could scan to view\nbusinesses’ catalogs and interact with their businesses in other ways.\n\nThree months later on March 29, 2012, 14 months -- or 433 days --  after V1.0\nlaunch, WeChat crossed [http://tech.163.com/14/0228/14/9M67OQ9100094ODU.html] \n100,000,000 users. For comparison, of what it took other\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/01/20/the-social-media-platforms-that-hit-100-million-us.aspx] \ntop social apps to reach 100M users:\n\n * Instagram: 26 months\n * Myspace: 36 months\n * Snapchat: 44 months\n * Facebook: 52 months\n * Twitter: 65 months\n\nWeChat’s next big release, Version 4.0 added “Moments” and birthed its English\nname “WeChat”. At this point, Weixin (pronounced approximately “way-shin”) had\n100 million users, mostly in China, and the company decided that to open up to a\nmore global audience, it needed an English name. Thus, “WeChat” was born.\n\nSome context on Moments: In the background of the development of WeChat, Tencent\nhad been fighting another war against Sina Weibo\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo]. Sina Corporation’s Weibo (which\nmeans “microblog”) is a Twitter-like product that allows users to post short\ntweets/microblogs (big oversimplification). By leveraging their QQ social graph,\nTencent was able to amass a large user base for its Weibo product which they\nlaunched 8 months after Sina’s launch. Ultimately Tencent fell short. In a 2012\nearnings report, Tencent said, “As the slow pace of Chinese Weibo user growth,\nwe are seeking an integral point for Tencent Weibo and WeChat, so as to manifest\nour characteristics”\n\nThus, I believe Moments was built largely because Tencent failed to create their\nown killer Weibo app. (This wound up being a great failure)\n\nMoments is a social tab within the WeChat app built around the principle that\n\"my friend's friend is not my friend\". In practice, this means that if I post a\nphoto or status update on my Moment’s feed, only my friends can see, like, and\ncomment on my Moment.\n\nThere also isn’t a unique link for Moments (i.e. \nhttps://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh is my Twitter, but there is no\nWeChat.com/moments/ryanrodenbaugh).\n\nHere are some of my Moments and what they look like in the latest version of\nWeChat:\n\nThe one on the left shows you what the “likes” look like, whereas the one on the\nright gives a better look at the comment functionality. In the photo on the\nright, the person who commented “LMAO” is not friends with any of my other\nWeChat friends so no one besides me can see her comments or the fact that she\nliked my photo. In the photo on the left, the woman who commented “wow” shares a\nbunch of mutual friends with me so all of those mutual friends can see her\ncomment (how nice of her!!).\n\nTo make a western comparison, I would describe Moments as a cross between\nTwitter and Instagram. The scrolling experience on Moments feels like scrolling\nInstagram where I am only seeing the content of people I follow (i.e., no RTs).\nAlso, the commenting and liking features look more like Instagram. The content\non the feed feels more like Twitter though where it is a mix of pure text,\narticles with commentary, and photos. The one caveat is that, in general, the\ncontent I see from my friends on Moments tends to be more personal (photos of\nthem with family, at a dinner, of their cat) than what my friends post on\nTwitter.\n\nIn May of 2013, WeChat introduced Version 5.0, which was focused on B2C\nofferings and monetization. WeChat debuted\n[https://tech.qq.com/a/20130607/022793.htm] official/public accounts, games, an\nupdated QR code, and payments (!!).\n\nWith more than 300 million users, WeChat still did not have a firm monetization\nstrategy. Games were their first approach. They added 11 games (games are\nTencent’s bread and butter) into the WeChat app. The games allowed for in-app\n‘virtual currency’ purchasing.\n\nFrom early on, WeChat was a fan of working with partners and splitting revenue\nwhen possible. Two of the eleven games came from developers other than Tencent\nand had a revenue share agreement included. Around this time, WeChat also added\na “sticker shop” where external designers could receive a cut of revenues that\ncame from selling their digital products. Designers’ split ranged from 40-70% of\nrevenues depending\n[https://technode.com/2013/10/21/tencent-to-share-emoticon-sales-with-third-party-designers/] \non how much was sold.\n\nThis was the first(?) instance where WeChat where users were able to link their\nbank account to “WeChat Payments” enabling in-app purchasing for games and\ndigital goods.\n\nVersion 5.0 also saw an improved QR code that included “scan to translate”, the\nability to scan barcodes and then place online orders for the product, and the\nability to scan QR codes to make payments.\n\nThe other update in V5.0 was the release of official/public accounts. These were\nblog-like official accounts for brands and influencers with a lot of\nfunctionality for businesses, brands, and influencers to interact with\nconsumers. Some examples that were published at the time included:\n\n * China Southern Airlines: Allowing users to check the weather forecast,\n   interactive mileage check, and membership display\n * Best Express\n   [https://web.archive.org/web/20130708115711/http:/technode.com/2013/07/05/nine-ways-to-do-business-with-wechat-official-accounts-part-ii/]\n   : Was a shipping and logistics company that via WeChat public accounts could\n   allow users to “realize the functions of package tracking, online-store\n   searching, service assessment, reservation, and complaints “\n * China Merchant Bank\n   [https://web.archive.org/web/20130624161223/http:/technode.com/2013/06/18/china-merchants-bank-tries-deeper-integration-with-wechat/]\n   : Was a custom integration by WeChat allowing users to check their bills,\n   credit limits, transaction records, and more. It’s highlighted in the media\n   coverage that previously this type of information would have been sent to\n   users via SMS.\n\nIt’s hard to pinpoint exactly when WeChat became a “Super App”, but this feels\nlike a good point to consider. On my phone right now, I have separate airline\napps, package tracking apps, and banking apps. If I was Chinese/living in China,\nI would not need those. These “official accounts” would evolve into something\nmuch bigger, but this is the first point at which brands could build their\nbusiness (and customer touchpoints) on top of WeChat.\n\nAround this time, WeChat also began partnering with physical businesses to offer\nonline store functionality where in-person businesses could set up a digital\nstorefront and sell goods. Their first\n[http://www.ebrun.com/20130910/81509.shtml] pilot was with a Chinese department\nstore. They also tried something with McDonald's where you could buy a coupon\nvoucher within WeChat and then show the QR code to your McDonalds Cashier to\nredeem the offer.\n\nBy Q3 2013, WeChat had\n[https://technode.com/2013/10/24/wechat-reportedly-surpassed-600-million-users/] \nmore than 600 million registered accounts with more than 100 million overseas\nusers and 271.9 million monthly active users. For perspective, in February of\nthat same year, they had 300 million registered users.\n\nIn WeChat’s December 2013 update, Version 5.1 focused on payments.\n\nIn addition to in-app game purchases, users were\n[https://technode.com/2013/12/24/tech-in-china-2013-wechat-is-everything/] able\nto use WeChat pay for phone bills, digital lottery tickets, shopping on\nTencent’s online retailer Yixun, purchases at a Ubox [http://ubox.cn/] vending\nmachine, or Haidilao, the most famous hotpot chain restaurant in China.\n\nWeChat also upgraded the public accounts to have “services accounts”. These were\nbrand focused accounts where brands could message their users directly (think of\nit as a CRM). Service accounts were limited to only sending one bulk push\nmarketing message per month to reduce users feeling cluttered or spammed\n[https://jingdaily.com/wechat-5-0-how-brands-can-gain-big-from-powerful-new-features/]\n. This inclination to limit messages from brands stems from Allen’s deep love of \nproduct and his insight that brands spamming users would ruin users’\nrelationship with the WeChat product.\n\nWeChat saw the importance of payments and employed some good old growth hacking\ntechniques to get more users to connect WeChat to their bank accounts.\n\nIn December 2013, WeChat allowed users to make group chats of 100 people but \neach user could only be the owner of one 100-person group. To promote\n[https://technode.com/2013/12/18/wechat-5-1-version/] WeChat Pay adoption,\nWeChat allowed users to own another two 100-person groups after having signed up\nfor WeChat Pay and an additional fourth group if the user used WeChat Pay. This\nwas notably different than how Tencent’s QQ desktop messenger worked where users\nwould have had to have paid for a premium subscription if they wanted to have\nlarge group chats.\n\nWeChat also added the ability for users to have default shipping addresses,\nmaking shipments (and the payment process) more seamless.\n\nBack in the Spring of 2013, Tencent made a $15 million-dollar investment in the\nthen-nascent Chinese ride-hailing app, Didi, buying a 20% stake in the company.\nOn January 2, 2014, they invested another $30 million into Didi as a part of a\n$100 million round (today, Didi is valued at ~$50-60 billion).\n\nA few days after their second investment in Didi in January of 2014, WeChat and\nDidi announced a partnership where on the WeChat Pay page, you could directly\n“order a taxi” using Didi’s service. As a promotion, users who paid with WeChat\nPay had a 10 Yuan (~$1-2) subsidy applied to their rides. For WeChat, this gave\nusers a great reason to set up their WeChat Pay given that Didi had a ~60%\nmarket share in Chinese ride-hailing at the time. For Didi, this gave them more\ndirect access to WeChat’s hundreds of millions of monthly active users\n[https://www.techinasia.com/china-hail-taxi-pay-driver-wechat]. The promotion\nwas a big win, with some large cities like Wuhan (a population of ~11 million)\nseeing 60% [https://www.36kr.com/p/1641825402881] of DiDi users switch over to\nWeChat Pay.\n\nDuring the Chinese New Year (late January) it is a tradition for family members\nto give each other 红包 🧧 (Hong Bao, Red Envelopes) with a little bit of money\ninside.\n\nDuring the 2014 CNY celebration, WeChat enabled users to send hóngbāo to their\nWeChat friends. You could (and still can) either send an envelope directly to a\nfriend or to a group of people where they can split up the monies. The best part\nfor WeChat? To send or receive the money, you needed to be signed up with WeChat\nPay.\n\n(Source)\n[https://www.techinasia.com/wechat-viral-hit-china-users-gift-chinese-year-cash-buddies]\n\nDuring the 2014 celebration, it led to hundreds of millions of red envelopes\nbeing sent and more importantly, brought the number of WeChat Pay users from 30\nmillion to 100 million\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-chinesenewyear/chinas-tencent-celebrates-year-of-horse-with-mobile-gifts-idUSBREA0S0L120140129]\n. Funny enough, WeChat Pay’s main competitor, Alipay (by Alibaba) launched a\nsimilar feature two years earlier, but it never took off the way WeChat’s\nfeature did. Alibaba founder Jack Ma called it\n[https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money] \na “Pearl Harbor moment” for his company.\n\nRed envelopes also had a cultural subtlety that made them very attractive.\nChinese people enjoy gaming and gambling. Red Envelopes built both of those\naspects into the product. For example\n[https://www.fastcompany.com/3065255/china-wechat-tencent-red-envelopes-and-social-money]\n, when you send an envelope,\n\n> “You can put $5 in a red envelope and [send it to a group chat with 5 people\nand] set it to disburse equally, so each friend gets $1. Alternatively, you\ncould stipulate that the first two people to tap will get all the money in equal\nportions—$2.50 each—or that the first two people get a random cut, maybe $1 for\none person and $4 for the other. The result is that any time a red envelope\nappears, people scramble to tap on it as fast as possible”\nDuring the 2015 Lunar New Year, ~1 billion red envelopes were sent, and by the\n2016 Lunar New Year, WeChat logged ~8 billion Red Envelopes sent.\n\nSource: QZ\n[https://qz.com/613384/over-8-billion-red-envelopes-were-sent-over-wechat-during-chinese-new-year/]\n\nLike how Tencent had a popular messaging app (QQ) before WeChat, they also had a\npayments app (“TenPay”) before WeChat Pay. TenPay was always smaller than\nAlipay, but with the penetration of WeChat’s users and promotions via WeChat\nPay, WeChat Pay was able to compete against Alipay in a way that “TenPay” was\nnot. (FWIW, TenPay still exists and sometimes analysts will use TenPay\ninterchangeably with “WeChat Pay” since I think it is technically the same\ninfrastructure/digital banking license)\n\nIn 2014, WeChat upgraded their services pages to allow brands to set up stores\nwithin the WeChat app (originally called “WeChat Little Store”). Consider these\nlike mini-Shopify-Esque pages within the WeChat app. Stores could upload and\nmanage items, show inventory, receive payment (via WeChat Pay), and ship\nproducts to users. This was around the same time that Tencent gave up on some of\ntheir e-commerce ambitions and secede to JD.com, taking a large ownership stake\nin JD in the process.\n\nCommerce is uniquely smooth within WeChat because payments are so deeply\nintegrated into the app. These “WeChat Little Stores” did a lot to turn WeChat\ninto a commerce search engine. Rather than e.g., going to Baidu and searching\n“Nike” and then going to their site, putting in payment info, shipping info, and\nmaking a purchase, you can just search Nike store on WeChat and payments and\nshipping info are also integrated. It’s a storefront built on top of a payments\napp, rather than a payment experience build into a website.\n\nBy June 2014, SMS texting was basically declared DEAD in China. It was reported\n[https://www.techinasia.com/china-has-700-million-mobile-internet-users-crushing-sms-to-average-40-per-month] \nat the time that the average Chinese person sent about 1 text/day in a period\nwhen China added 27 million new phone subscribers.\n\nIn July 2014, Tech in Asia published an article\n[http://expatadvisorscommunity.com.au/updates/story-of-zhang-xiaolong-founder-of-wechat/] \nforeshadowing the growing trend in China of entrepreneurs choosing to build\ntheir apps solely on WeChat and not bothering with iOS and Android applications.\nThough there are tradeoffs to not having your own app, one founder said, “With\n400 million active WeChat users, getting access to them outweighs any cons.”\n\nOne year after adding payments, WeChat was already persuading founders to build\ntheir applications solely on their platform.\n\nVery similar to Shopify “arming the rebels”, WeChat saw that it was expensive\nfor retailers to get noticed on big e-commerce platforms in China like JD,\nTaobao, etc. WeChat gave merchants a direct way to sell to their consumers.\n\nIn September 2014, WeChat Pay added the massive feature of allowing users to pay\nfor in-store purchases with QR codes. Initially, this feature was only\n[https://www.pingwest.com/a/36782] supported by large merchants (e.g., Dairy\nQueen), but in 2020, virtually every single vendor in China from taxis to street\nvendors to Gucci stores support QR payments via WeChat Pay (and AliPay, which\ncame to market with this QR code feature a few years before WeChat Pay).\n\nBy Q4 of 2014, WeChat crossed\n[https://fintechranking.com/2015/03/18/wechat-now-has-500-million-monthly-active-users/] \n500 million global monthly active users, up from 355 million in Q4’13.\n\nWeChat also continued to push their monetization by allowing ads to show in the\n“Moments” feed. Anecdotally, as an active scroller of “Moments,” the ads have\nnever once felt intrusive or annoying.\n\nAround 2015, WeChat implemented what I found to be one of their coolest features\nand it is a testament to what you can do when you have deeply integrated\npayments. Public accounts were able to add a “tipping” feature or put a paywall\nin front of their content. Online tipping is a huge industry in China with lots\nof streamers and content creators monetizing their content this way. With two\nclicks, you can tip content creators on WeChat. Easy as that. By 2017, about\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=jONiDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=tipping+creators+on+wechat+2016&source=bl&ots=0mEp4FY26H&sig=ACfU3U0Ie2Oit6-S9iV6-GVQKGBQVHe2Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjdjJOrz9zpAhXYJjQIHfCDA3QQ6AEwCHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=tipping%20creators%20on%20wechat%202016&f=false] \n11% of WeChat users (that’s a lot of people!) had used the function. Tencent\nwould eventually run into problems with Apple’s transaction policies for iOS\nusers, but more on this later.\n\nIn April of 2016, at a time when Slack was valued at about $3.6 billion, WeChat\nlaunched WeChat Enterprise (later renamed WeChat Work). At first, the offering\nincluded all of WeChat’s core features (chat, voice messaging, send location,\netc.) with the addition of work-related features such as requesting time off.\n\nI believe one of the reasons they did this was that many people were already\nusing WeChat for work, but because they now had so many work-related chats and\ncontacts, people might have started feeling hesitant posting to Moments. A\npersonal anecdote to support this… I made a WeChat account because I was doing a\nlot of business with people in China. For me, WeChat was first a business app,\nbut over time as I made more and more Chinese friends, I also had a lot of\npersonal relations on the app. I’ve always posted personal and funny things on\nmy Moments (as you saw above), but I had a lot of friends who said that because\nthey had so many work friends on their personal account, they posted less on\ntheir Moments. On that note, it’s also not uncommon for people to have multiple\nWeChat accounts (one for family and close friends and one for work-related\ncontacts)\n\nAs of February 2020, 60 million users across 2.5 million organizations were\nusing WeChat Work (all in China, btw). It was reported\n[https://www.pingwest.com/a/36782] that 80% of China’s Fortune 500 and 81% of\nthe top retail organizations in China used WeChat Work (wow!). They’ve also\nadded all the other features you’d come to expect from an offering of this kind\n(file sharing, expense account management, etc.)\n\nFor comparison, Microsoft Teams had 75 million daily active users (32 million\npre-COVID) and Slack’s last public number in October 2019 was 12 million DAU.\n\nThroughout the 6.0 Version upgrades of the WeChat core app, the updates were\nlargely nice to have features e.g., group video calls, WeRun (a Strava-like\nproduct), etc.\n\nOne of WeChat’s biggest product additions came in early 2017 with the formal\nintroduction of “mini-programs”. By this time WeChat had\n[https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/wechat-mini-programs/] 846 million monthly\nactive users and 768 million daily active users.\n\nMini-programs are “light apps” (though Apple wouldn’t let WeChat call them\n“apps”) that lived inside of the WeChat application. While some of the apps are\nfrom independent companies (e.g., a startup that makes a camera filter app),\nmany of them are created by brands who want more ways to interact with\ncustomers. For example [https://www.techinasia.com/wechat-mini-programs-launch],\nNike has a mini-program that looks like a full-fledged store, McDonald’s has one\nfor coupons, movie theaters have mini-programs to buy tickets, and Didi has one\nto get a ride.\n\nOne year after launch in January 2018, there were\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/wechat-strategy/chinas-wechat-plans-to-resurrect-tipping-button-after-agreement-with-apple-idUSL3N1PA1UJ] \n580,000 mini-programs on WeChat with 170 million daily active users. By the end\nof 2018, mini-programs had 600 million monthly active users and it seems about\n200 million were daily active users.\n\nIn 2019, mini-programs weren’t just appealing to big brands like Nike, but also\nto the long tail of stores, “Niche apps within WeChat, such as\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-11/tencent-s-mini-programs-could-open-up-wechat-for-business-use?sref=hyzbRjRU] \nthose used by a parent-teacher group or neighborhood grocery store, accounted\nmore than half of total Mini Programs traffic.”\n\nYou could think of it like, in the US, we have Slice [https://slicelife.com/] so\nthat pizza store owners can have a digital presence with delivery and Joe.Coffee\n[https://joe.coffee/] for coffee shop owners to offer a mobile experience… but\nin China, every single physical store can have a digital presence through a\nMini-Program. That analogy isn’t perfect, but it approximately frames the\nsituation.\n\nSomething that sets WeChat mini-programs apart from regular apps or foreign\nequivalents is that by default, it is integrated with all other parts of the\nWeChat ecosystem: payments, live streaming/video, ability to interact with\noffline QR codes, geo-location, social connections, notifications, and all the\nother WeChat features. As a Tencent executive said\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-11/tencent-s-mini-programs-could-open-up-wechat-for-business-use?sref=hyzbRjRU] \nat a conference, “Just build a good Mini Program, and we’ll do the rest.”\n\nTencent shared in its 2019 annual report that the number of daily transactions\nwithin mini-programs doubled YoY and that the total 2019 transaction volume\nexceeded RMB 800 billion ($112 billion).\n\nMost WeChat programs fall into three overarching buckets, games, e-commerce, and\nlifestyle (which admittedly is a catch-all for everything from ride-hailing to\ncleaning services). Some examples of the diversity of WeChat programs are:\n\n * Tencent’s video app where you can watch full-length TV shows like Game of\n   Thrones\n * Chinese to English translation programs\n * Bike-sharing programs\n * Audio tourism guides for major cities\n * And games, lots and lots of games!\n\nOne of the reasons Baidu (“Google of China”) has dreaded WeChat and\nmini-programs so much is that mini-programs have strong SEO, leading a lot of\nChinese people to start their searches in mini-programs. For example, if you\nwanted to buy new running shoes, you might start that search in WeChat\nmini-programs rather than Baidu. This is a partial explanation for why Baidu\nstock is down 50% from its all-time high.\n\nWeChat Launched 6.0 in late 2014 and then took about 4 years before launching\n7.0 in January\n[https://blog.wechat.com/2019/01/18/whats-new-in-wechat-7-0-the-biggest-upgrade-in-four-years/] \nof 2019. In that intervening period, WeChat continued to grow at an incredible\nrate across it’s messaging features, payment features, mini-programs, etc. but\nthey did not add many new features during that time. There were few updates to\nVersion 7.0, which speaks to more of Allen’s product principles of keeping\nthings simple and not changing too fast on users.\n\nConclusion (to Part 1)\nI remember reading the book “House of Lies\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/885937.House_Of_Lies]” about management\nconsulting where a non-McKinsey consultant is feeling envious of McKinsey and is\ntrying to get McKinsey out of his mind. As he goes through his day, he realizes\neverything he interacts with has some connection to McKinsey. He goes to brush\nhis teeth, but the Colgate CEO is ex-McKinsey, he puts on his shoes and the\nshoemaker CEO is ex-McKinsey, and so on.\n\nIn China, you can have a similar kind of day all where all your interactions\ntouch the WeChat app.\n\n * You wake up and check the weather on a WeChat mini program\n * You call a Didi through a WeChat mini program\n * You buy your breakfast with WeChat Pay\n * You get to work and login to WeChat Work\n * You send your mom a red packet for her birthday on WeChat\n\nYou get the point.\n\nThe evolution of WeChat can be seen as “Social App” —> Platform —> Operating\nsystem\n\nThough WeChat did not invent the idea of a ‘Super App’ (more on that in a later\npost), they are the first incarnation of the concept. My prior two posts on \nGojek [__GHOST_URL__/gojek/] and Grab [__GHOST_URL__/grab/] are examples of\ncompanies who are trying to brand themselves as and become full-blown Super\nApps, inspired by what WeChat has done.\n\nThat said, there are a lot of subtleties to WeChat that made it especially\npoised to be the world’s first and biggest Super App. More on that in the next\npost 😉\n\n(If you got this far, thank you so much for reading ❤️)\n\nThis post was getting very long, so I broke it into two parts.

I wrote it while I\nwas a research analyst covering VR and AR technologies. \n\nIn a roadshow video [http://snap.netroadshow.com/retail/disclaimer.aspx] leading\nup to the Snap IPO (infographic with key points of the IPO here\n[http://files.pitchbook.com/pdf/PitchBook-Snap_IPO-_Datagraphic.pdf]) CEO Evan\nSpiegel, said of the company, “We’re at the beginning of what cameras can do.”\n\nThat beginning refers to Snap, Inc.’s potential to become the first big player\nin consumer augmented reality. Snap is beginning to roll out more and more\nhardware products, which is likely a push to both attract investors and create\nproducts that are more difficult for other companies\n[https://www.producthunt.com/@jackdweck/collections/stories-format?utm_campaign=236_2017-03-01&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Product+Hunt&utm_term=editorial]\nto copy.\n\nSnap is rolling out popular AR-enabled features and although these features are\nthe most widely used\n[http://mashable.com/2016/12/06/most-downloaded-apps-2016/#nQJuOJ2925q8]AR\nfeatures available to any consumer, the company has not branded the features as\naugmented reality. Over the past two years, Snap has rolled out different AR\ncapabilities within the mobile app (including: lenses\n[https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/a-whole-new-way-to-see-yourselfie/], \nsponsored lenses [https://www.snapchat.com/ads/sponsored-lenses], Face Swap\n[http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/social-networks/how-face-swap-in-snapchat-other-apps-new-summary-video-3636570/]\n, Spectacles [https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/introducing-spectacles/], \nScissors [https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/happy-holidays/], and Paintbrush\n[https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/happy-holidays/]) while simultaneously\ngrowing the user base to 158 million daily active users.\n\nImage by meAt the same time, however, all of these product updates have been\nfairly easy for other companies (i.e., Facebook) to duplicate. In a recent\narticle covering the AI teams at Facebook, Facebook’s Director of Applied\nMachine Learning Joaquin Candela highlighted a new product feature\n[https://research.fb.com/people/candela-joaquin-quinonero/].\n\n“[The technology] redraws a photo or streams a video in the style of an art\nmasterpiece by a distinctive painter,” Candela said. “In fact, it’s reminiscent\nof the kind of digital stunt you’d see on Snapchat, and the idea of\ntransmogrifying photos into Picasso’s cubism has already been accomplished.”\n\nThe fierce competition for potentially the same users becomes particularly\nevident in the roll-out of Instagram Stories. Snapchat debuted in 2011 and per\nits S-1 filing in February, the mobile app had 158 million daily active users.\nInstagram rolled out Instagram Stories in early August of 2016 and as of\nDecember 2016 (5 months after launch), the product was driving 150 million\ndaily\nactive users\n[http://blog.business.instagram.com/post/155717870326/business-insights-and-ads-in-stories]\n. In that time, Instagram has also introduced ads and a portal for businesses to\nuse the product to create engaging content for its users.\n\nSocial media sites are built on network effects -- the more users, the more\nvalue the product adds. Instagram has a total of 600 million users, 100 million\nof which joined in the past 6 months. Snap has not released a total users\nfigure, but being that the product is built upon disappearing photos, the total\nuser base would not be too far off from daily active users. As Instagram\ncontinues to grow the stories feature, it becomes increasingly important that\nSnap becomes a diversified business and not just a social media platform.\n\n\nImage by me\nMoving forward, and if leveraged correctly, Snap could go on to drive a\ncompetitive advantage in its hardware products. As Instagram has demonstrated\nwith the stories feature, Snap’s successful software features can be replicated.\nTo stay ahead of the competition, Snap’s best bet is to invest more resources\ninto hardware products. Other companies would have a difficult time succeeding\nin copying Snap’s success in hardware.\n\nImage by Snap, Inc.Spectacles, Snap’s answer to product diversity, is both tech\nand sunglasses.

There’s some positive reinforcing loop here.</p><p>Besides riding the smartphone wave, WeChat, along with their duopoly competitor, Alipay, crested and then rode the payments wave.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63c1976f-942c-47dd-9a73-88f451b26cbe_646x616.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>(<a href=\"https://walkthechat.com/the-cross-border-payment-war-of-wechat-pay-and-alipay/\">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>CB Insights points out <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/ant-financial-alipay-fintech/\">that</a>, “These growing use cases for mobile payments in the everyday lives of Chinese consumers catapulted China’s mobile payment volume from $1T in 2015 to $15.5T in 2017, with WeChat Pay and Alipay making up a whopping 92% of China’s total mobile payment volume as of Q3’17.”</p><p>In terms of WeChat Pay via QR codes, China also notably <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/visa-plaid-follow-up-apple-v-fbi-round-2-2020-differences/\">skipped</a> the era of plastic cards.</p><blockquote><em>China, meanwhile, was almost entirely cash-based one decade ago; that was the context for the rise of mobile payments, which represented their own gargantuan leap forward.</em></blockquote><p>In my view, another chicken and egg situation. Did the fact that China ‘skipped’ the era of plastic cards allow WeChat Pay and Alipay to flourish or did China skip plastic cards because of WeChat Pay and Alipay?</p><h2 id=\"expanding-finance-\"><strong><strong>Expanding Finance:</strong></strong></h2><p>To be a truly generalizable Super App, I believe you need to own your user’s wallet. This is part of a larger thesis on Super Apps that I’ll talk about in my next post.</p><p>In my last post, I proposed that WeChat began morphing into a true “Super App” at the point where it added official accounts (a pre-cursor for mini-programs) in May of 2013. In that same update (WeChat Version 5.0) WeChat added payments and the ability to buy stickers (one of their first monetization attempts).</p><p>In Q4 2019, WeChat pay was doing more than 1 billion commercial transactions/day across its 800 million monthly active users and 50 million merchants. <strong>One way to think about WeChat mini-programs and their apps is that they’re storefronts built on top of a payment app, rather than a payment experience build into a website.</strong></p><p>It’s actually a bit fuzzy where Tencent makes money on WeChat Pay. They don’t break out payments from “FinTech” and “business services” in their financial statements, but I am going to imagine they have a set up like Apple Wallet where they take a small fee on transactions (e.g., 0.15%) that otherwise would have gone to the banks/card issuers.</p><p>Six years later, in 2019, FinTech offerings drove $11.9 billion (22% of) Tencent’s <a href=\"https://walkthechat.com/%c2%a5800-billion-wechat-mini-program-transaction-volume-in-2019-tencent-annual-report/\">total</a> revenue.</p><p>WalkTheChat <a href=\"https://walkthechat.com/%c2%a5800-billion-wechat-mini-program-transaction-volume-in-2019-tencent-annual-report/\">estimates</a> what the WeChat Pay growth looks like over time:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11a37b5d-8cd5-4421-b990-24f699ae337e_1024x756.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>(<a href=\"https://walkthechat.com/%c2%a5800-billion-wechat-mini-program-transaction-volume-in-2019-tencent-annual-report/\">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Besides the QR code payments that WeChat is well known for, they also offer FinTech products that include wealth management, consumer lending, insurance, and remittances, among many others.</p><p>To illustrate how big the Chinese FinTech market is, look no further than WeChat Pay’s most direct competitor, <a href=\"https://intl.alipay.com/\">AliPay</a> by Ant Financial (Alibaba). AliPay launched the Tianhong Yu’e Bao Money Market Fund (which basically amounted to a high-yield checking account) for users in 2013 and by 2017, it was the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-an-alibaba-spinoff-created-the-worlds-largest-money-market-fund-1505295000\">largest</a> money market fund in the world, surpassing offerings from JP Morgan, Fidelity, and Vanguard. By March 2019, the Tianhong Yu’e Bao fund (which translates to “leftover treasure”) <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-than-a-third-of-china-is-now-invested-in-one-giant-mutual-fund-11553682785\">had</a> about 588 million clients, 1/3 of the Chinese population.</p><p>In the fall of 2018, Tencent and WeChat launched their own similar product, LingQianTong (or “Mini Fund”). As of November 2019, it <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/ant-financial-tencent-fintech/\">looks like</a> WeChat’s product was managing about $112 billion and has been competing against AliPay’s product by offering higher interest rates. (A win for the consumers!)</p><p>One of the biggest contributions that WeChat Pay (and AliPay – but this issue isn’t about them!) has made has been bringing an entire country online to digital payments. China is the country with the highest rate of digital payments and its thanks to these two companies.</p><p>WeChat Pay also has a deep integration with “WeBank”, one of China’s first ‘neobanks’. WeBank could be the topic of another issue, but TL/DR is that WeBank is a Chinese neobank whose core revenue driver is acting as a broker connecting banks (lenders) with consumers and small businesses (borrowers) and taking a fee in the middle. WeBank’s largest shareholder is Tencent (~30%) and I believe the only reason Tencent doesn’t own more is due to some regulation around ownership levels of banks.</p><p>Like most countries, China has restrictions on banking licenses and consumer deposits. WeChat Pay (which is not a bank) has limits about how much you are able to transact annually (I believe ~30,000 USD), but once you hit that limit, WeChat <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wechats-first-serious-move-promote-webank-why-its-matthew-brennan/\">recommends</a> you to set-up an account with WeBank.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbcfec9c1-ec12-4808-88ed-e700e7631ae8_562x500.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"><figcaption>(<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wechats-first-serious-move-promote-webank-why-its-matthew-brennan/\">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>As Matthew Brennan further points out, in China, the way WeChat Pay initially worked was that the user connected their bank account/bank card (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionPay\">UnionPay</a>) with WeChat Pay and then made transactions.</p><p>In the new flow with WeBank, everything stays within the Tencent ecosystem and the bank account is no longer Union Bank, but rather WeBank!

He was very aware that Instagram was taking screentime away from Facebook and he did not like that.</p><p>Pony Ma of Tencent, on the other hand, showed that he meant this quote when he began taking resources away from Tencent’s very successful desktop messaging app QQ and investing all of Tencent’s vast resources behind WeChat.</p><h2 id=\"so-much-money-they-can-t-ignore-you\"><strong><strong>So </strong><em><strong>Much Money</strong></em><strong> They Can’t Ignore You</strong></strong></h2><p>WeChat basically failed at <em>WINNING</em> international markets with the same kind of ubiquity they have in China.

In many ways, <strong>WeChat is the operating system of the phone in China</strong>. On Android, Apple, or Huawei’s new OS, WeChat is the <strong>same app </strong>with the same functionality.</p><p>Flashback to 2017 when tipping was taking off within WeChat. Tencent was not taking any service fees on tips and Apple made them disable their tipping function because Apple considered the tips to be in-app purchases (i.e., Apple <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-tip-for-apple-in-china-your-hunger-for-revenue-may-cost-you-1495100964?mod=article_inline\">needed</a> their 30% <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=vig\">vig</a>). About 7 months later, Apple reversed their ruling (or WeChat made a change) that allowed for tips to resume on iOS.</p><p>Contrary to what I said two paragraphs above, for 7 months where tipping was disabled within WeChat on iOS, WeChat on iOS <em>was actually</em> inferior to other operating systems.</p><p>It’s hard to think of a western comparison but imagine your favorite/most used/most important mobile app did not work well on your phone. Say you had an iPhone and your WhatsApp, Twitter, or Email client was a really bad experience on your phone and that problem was unique to Apple iOS. Would you consider switching to a different operating system? Maybe.</p><p>As Allen Zhang <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-and-tencent-reach-deal-to-let-wechat-users-dole-out-tips-1516018849\">said</a> in a speech, even companies like Apple didn’t fully grasp WeChat and China:</p><blockquote><em>“In the past, companies like Apple might have had a difficult time understanding China-specific features,” Mr. Zhang said, according to a transcript of his remarks provided by Tencent. “We now all share a mutual understanding and we’ll soon bring back the “tip” function.”</em></blockquote><p>Something about that last sentence, “<em>We now all share a mutual understanding” </em>seems so subtly powerful and chilling to me. WeChat is making sure that others share an understanding <em>with them.</em></p><p>In many ways, mini-programs are a threat to the Apple iOS. Ben Thompson has written <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/company/tencent/wechat/\">extensively</a> and informed my thinking on this topic. Apple only has a 50% iPhone retention rate in China, whereas Apple enjoys ~80% retention for iPhones in the rest of the world. iPhones are “hardware differentiated by software” and in China, the Apple OS software matters a lot less than in the rest of the world.</p><p>Let’s look at it on a feature-by-feature level.</p><p>What are the iPhone’s biggest lock-ins for users?</p><ul><li>iMessage (Blue texts) – Doesn’t matter when all messaging happens over WeChat. As we covered in the last issue, SMS texting was basically declared dead in China in 2014 with the average Chinese person sending only about 1 text/day.</li><li>FaceTime – Doesn’t matter when all calls happen over WeChat</li><li>App Store – Doesn’t matter in a world of mini-programs</li><li>Apple Wallet/Card – Doesn’t matter with WeChat Pay</li><li>Services – Apple TV, Music, Arcade. Some of these might hold value, but in China, you could instead use Tencent Music and play games on WeChat</li><li>AirPods – Ok, they’re still pretty good :) but there are no shortage of cheaper knock-offs in China</li></ul><p>Here are some <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-tencents-wechat-poses-creeping-threat-to-apple\">statistics</a> from The Information and Sensor Tower showing app growth decline in China:</p><blockquote><em>At the same time, the number of iOS apps downloaded in China in 2019 has fallen 12% from a peak of 9.3 billion in 2017, according to Sensor Tower. That compares with an increase of 22% to 7.1 billion apps downloaded in the U.S. over the same period. And developers are making fewer new apps for iPhone users in China. The number of iOS apps available in China as of February was down 20% from a peak of 1.84 million in 2018, Chinese government data shows. Meanwhile, App Store revenue growth in China has slowed to 11% in 2019 from triple-digit growth rates in 2015 and 2016, according to analytics firm App Annie.</em></blockquote><h2 id=\"mobile-mobile-mobile\"><strong><strong>Mobile, Mobile, Mobile</strong></strong></h2><p>I remember the first time I ever saw the WeChat app was in college. The girl next to me had the desktop app up and it was the ugliest Mac App I had ever seen. But to be frank, I don’t think Tencent cares that much about their desktop experience. In fact, WeChat did not launch a Mac desktop app <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/02/28/messaging-service-wechat-launches-a-native-os-x-client-making-the-mac-its-first-desktop-platform/\">until</a> 2014 and didn’t launch its Windows app <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/01/28/wechat-finally-arrives-desktop-windows-users/\">until</a> 2015.</p><p>WeChat, unlike many Western apps I use, has a notably worse desktop experience than mobile experience because the app is meant for mobile consumption.

Decision making at WeChat is very top-down, where yes, Allen encourages ideas from the team, but the final decision for everything related to the product rests on his shoulders. As is <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/10/the-kind-of-creative-thinking-that-fueled-wechats-success\">described</a> in a good HBR article:</p><blockquote>As Allen Zhang told us: “We encourage people who present their own way of thinking – I encourage them to speak out.” <strong>But at the same time, it is clear that he makes all the key decisions himself</strong>.  As his colleagues explained, they submit new features to him for approval, and he decides on the icon, the nickname, and other key aspects of the user experience. Developers are keenly aware that the biggest challenge is how to ‘get past Allen’, and that many seemingly good features are vetoed by him.</blockquote><p>WeChat is an intuition led (<a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/02/05/allen-zhang-wechat-product-principles/\">not KPI</a> led) product. This stands in opposition to the Facebook metric-driven-growth philosophy. The western consumer apps that were historically most product-led were Snapchat and Instagram (less so now given FB acquisition and founders leaving).</p><p>In 2019, at the annual WeChat conference (like an Apple product launch event), Allen delivered a well-documented 4-hour speech. It gives great insight into his philosophy and was translated into English <a href=\"https://blog.wechat.com/2019/03/18/what-is-wechats-dream-wechat-founder-allen-zhang-explains/\">here</a>. One line that sticks,</p><blockquote>“Think for a second, how much time do you spend on WeChat every day? Do you spend more time with your closest family and friends, or with WeChat?

This article\nwill focus on the themes of the company and some of the key elements of its\nmonster success.\n\nRight Place, Right Time\nWeChat users grew in tandem\n[https://www.scmp.com/tech/article/2159831/how-wechat-became-chinas-everyday-mobile-app] \nwith smartphone growth in China.\n\nIn 2010, when WeChat was still a research project, there were only 36 million\nsmartphone sales in China. That number increased to 90 million in 2011 when\nWeChat was officially launched and had rocketed to 214 million by 2012.\n\nAs of late 2019, China had 851 million smartphone users, accounting for 26% of\nthe world’s smartphone users. According to Statista\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/255552/penetration-rate-of-mobile-internet-users-in-china/]\n, “In March 2020, around 99.3 percent of internet users in China used mobile\nphones to go online.”\n\nTalk about a massive TAM…\n\nThere is a bit of a chicken and egg question in my mind. It seems to me that\nWeChat rode the wave of mobile phones and mobile internet in China, but I’d also\nbe willing to wager that part of the reason that mobile internet (compared to\ndesktop internet) is so popular in China is because of the sophistication and\nbreadth of mobile apps, WeChat being the most relevant. There’s some positive\nreinforcing loop here.\n\nBesides riding the smartphone wave, WeChat, along with their duopoly competitor,\nAlipay, crested and then rode the payments wave.\n\n(Source\n[https://walkthechat.com/the-cross-border-payment-war-of-wechat-pay-and-alipay/]\n)CB Insights points out that\n[https://www.cbinsights.com/research/ant-financial-alipay-fintech/], “These\ngrowing use cases for mobile payments in the everyday lives of Chinese consumers\ncatapulted China’s mobile payment volume from $1T in 2015 to $15.5T in 2017,\nwith WeChat Pay and Alipay making up a whopping 92% of China’s total mobile\npayment volume as of Q3’17.”\n\nIn terms of WeChat Pay via QR codes, China also notably skipped\n[https://stratechery.com/2020/visa-plaid-follow-up-apple-v-fbi-round-2-2020-differences/] \nthe era of plastic cards.\n\n> China, meanwhile, was almost entirely cash-based one decade ago; that was the\ncontext for the rise of mobile payments, which represented their own gargantuan\nleap forward.\nIn my view, another chicken and egg situation. Did the fact that China ‘skipped’\nthe era of plastic cards allow WeChat Pay and Alipay to flourish or did China\nskip plastic cards because of WeChat Pay and Alipay?\n\nExpanding Finance:\nTo be a truly generalizable Super App, I believe you need to own your user’s\nwallet. This is part of a larger thesis on Super Apps that I’ll talk about in my\nnext post.\n\nIn my last post, I proposed that WeChat began morphing into a true “Super App”\nat the point where it added official accounts (a pre-cursor for mini-programs)\nin May of 2013. In that same update (WeChat Version 5.0) WeChat added payments\nand the ability to buy stickers (one of their first monetization attempts).\n\nIn Q4 2019, WeChat pay was doing more than 1 billion commercial transactions/day\nacross its 800 million monthly active users and 50 million merchants. One way to\nthink about WeChat mini-programs and their apps is that they’re storefronts\nbuilt on top of a payment app, rather than a payment experience build into a\nwebsite.\n\nIt’s actually a bit fuzzy where Tencent makes money on WeChat Pay. They don’t\nbreak out payments from “FinTech” and “business services” in their financial\nstatements, but I am going to imagine they have a set up like Apple Wallet where\nthey take a small fee on transactions (e.g., 0.15%) that otherwise would have\ngone to the banks/card issuers.\n\nSix years later, in 2019, FinTech offerings drove $11.9 billion (22% of)\nTencent’s total\n[https://walkthechat.com/%c2%a5800-billion-wechat-mini-program-transaction-volume-in-2019-tencent-annual-report/] \nrevenue.\n\nWalkTheChat estimates\n[https://walkthechat.com/%c2%a5800-billion-wechat-mini-program-transaction-volume-in-2019-tencent-annual-report/] \nwhat the WeChat Pay growth looks like over time:\n\n(Source\n[https://walkthechat.com/%c2%a5800-billion-wechat-mini-program-transaction-volume-in-2019-tencent-annual-report/]\n)Besides the QR code payments that WeChat is well known for, they also offer\nFinTech products that include wealth management, consumer lending, insurance,\nand remittances, among many others.\n\nTo illustrate how big the Chinese FinTech market is, look no further than WeChat\nPay’s most direct competitor, AliPay [https://intl.alipay.com/] by Ant Financial\n(Alibaba). AliPay launched the Tianhong Yu’e Bao Money Market Fund (which\nbasically amounted to a high-yield checking account) for users in 2013 and by\n2017, it was the largest\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-an-alibaba-spinoff-created-the-worlds-largest-money-market-fund-1505295000] \nmoney market fund in the world, surpassing offerings from JP Morgan, Fidelity,\nand Vanguard. By March 2019, the Tianhong Yu’e Bao fund (which translates to\n“leftover treasure”) had\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-than-a-third-of-china-is-now-invested-in-one-giant-mutual-fund-11553682785] \nabout 588 million clients, 1/3 of the Chinese population.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, Tencent and WeChat launched their own similar product,\nLingQianTong (or “Mini Fund”). As of November 2019, it looks like\n[https://www.cbinsights.com/research/ant-financial-tencent-fintech/] WeChat’s\nproduct was managing about $112 billion and has been competing against AliPay’s\nproduct by offering higher interest rates. (A win for the consumers!)\n\nOne of the biggest contributions that WeChat Pay (and AliPay – but this issue\nisn’t about them!) has made has been bringing an entire country online to\ndigital payments. China is the country with the highest rate of digital payments\nand its thanks to these two companies.\n\nWeChat Pay also has a deep integration with “WeBank”, one of China’s first\n‘neobanks’. WeBank could be the topic of another issue, but TL/DR is that WeBank\nis a Chinese neobank whose core revenue driver is acting as a broker connecting\nbanks (lenders) with consumers and small businesses (borrowers) and taking a fee\nin the middle. WeBank’s largest shareholder is Tencent (~30%) and I believe the\nonly reason Tencent doesn’t own more is due to some regulation around ownership\nlevels of banks.\n\nLike most countries, China has restrictions on banking licenses and consumer\ndeposits. WeChat Pay (which is not a bank) has limits about how much you are\nable to transact annually (I believe ~30,000 USD), but once you hit that limit,\nWeChat recommends\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wechats-first-serious-move-promote-webank-why-its-matthew-brennan/] \nyou to set-up an account with WeBank.\n\n(Source\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wechats-first-serious-move-promote-webank-why-its-matthew-brennan/]\n)As Matthew Brennan further points out, in China, the way WeChat Pay initially\nworked was that the user connected their bank account/bank card (UnionPay\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionPay]) with WeChat Pay and then made\ntransactions.\n\nIn the new flow with WeBank, everything stays within the Tencent ecosystem and\nthe bank account is no longer Union Bank, but rather WeBank! Perhaps the western\ncomparison would be, instead of Apple partnering with Goldman Sachs to offer\nApple Card, imagine if they were the largest shareholder in a neobank that they\nrouted users to set up deposit accounts at.\n\n(Source\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wechats-first-serious-move-promote-webank-why-its-matthew-brennan/]\n)Many readers will be familiar with the very high customer acquisition costs for\nfintech companies. Well, imagine if you could launch your ‘neobank’ as an\nintegration with your country’s most used application. That’s the WeBank secret \nsauce [https://www.chinainternetwatch.com/22405/wechat-digital-bank-card/].\n\n> “Users can just login and register an account via the WeBank app,and create a\nnew account card within 2 minutes. Moreover, this digital bank card is as safe\nas traditional bank cards, consisting of the basic functions including bank\ntransfer, money deposit, consumption.\n> Tencent has totally integrated this digital bank card with WeChat, which is\ncommonly used by 963 million monthly active users\n[https://www.chinainternetwatch.com/22174/tencent-q2-2017/]. The money in users’\nWeChat accounts, and even other banks deposits, can be transferred to the\nWeBank’s account, and enjoy more than 4% annual interest rate.”\nDon’t Be Afraid to Cannibalize Yourself\nIn part one, I shared the crystal-ball like quote from Pony Ma:\n\n> Before starting TalkBox, Heatherm Huang recalls\n[https://technode.com/2018/08/22/talkbox-the-secret-history-of-wechat/] seeing\nPony Ma speak at a conference. Pony Ma shared that even though he had built\nChina’s most successful messaging app (QQ), he was paranoid that his empire\ncould still be destroyed. He hoped that if something was going to kill QQ that\nit be built by Tencent.\nI’ve heard versions of that sentiment ascribed to Mark Zuckerberg, as well. “If\nsomething is going to beat our product, I want it to be built here.”\n\nI’m reading the book No Filter\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50772888-no-filter] about the history of\nInstagram right now and it’s clear that Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t actually mean\nthat quote when he says it. He was very aware that Instagram was taking\nscreentime away from Facebook and he did not like that.\n\nPony Ma of Tencent, on the other hand, showed that he meant this quote when he\nbegan taking resources away from Tencent’s very successful desktop messaging app\nQQ and investing all of Tencent’s vast resources behind WeChat.\n\nSo Much Money They Can’t Ignore You\nWeChat basically failed at WINNING international markets with the same kind of\nubiquity they have in China. Even in neighboring countries throughout Southeast\nAsia or in India where WeChat made a concentrated push, Facebook, WhatsApp, and\napps local to each of those individual country rule.\n\nBUT WeChat has a few other things going for it.\n\nIf you want to interact with China, you need WeChat. Celebrities have fan pages,\nforeign businesses use mini-pages, and foreigners wanting to do business with\nthe Chinese are in a better place if they use WeChat. For a lot of Western\ncountries (e.g., USA, Australia) politicians do not like their citizens on\nWeChat (because of censorship and data privacy concerns), but it’s the fastest\nway to work and network with China.\n\nTourist hubs like Las Vegas and New York have also embraced WeChat Pay because…\n¥¥¥ ($$$). In just the first half of 2019, Chinese overseas tourist spending was\n[https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201910/06/WS5d99285ea310cf3e3556ede8.html] $128\nbillion.\n\nAs early as 2016, WeChat allowed users to convert their RMB into currencies\nincluding USD, GBP, HKD, EUR, etc. to be able to spend at foreign merchants.\n\n(Source\n[https://calvinayre.com/2017/08/10/casino/caesars-punts-wechat-pay-win-chinese-gamblers-las-vegas/]\n)WeChat and Apple:\nTo give some more perspective into WeChat’s global influence, let’s take a look\nat their relationship with Apple. In many ways, WeChat is the operating system\nof the phone in China. On Android, Apple, or Huawei’s new OS, WeChat is the same\napp with the same functionality.\n\nFlashback to 2017 when tipping was taking off within WeChat. Tencent was not\ntaking any service fees on tips and Apple made them disable their tipping\nfunction because Apple considered the tips to be in-app purchases (i.e., Apple \nneeded\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-tip-for-apple-in-china-your-hunger-for-revenue-may-cost-you-1495100964?mod=article_inline] \ntheir 30% vig [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=vig]). About 7\nmonths later, Apple reversed their ruling (or WeChat made a change) that allowed\nfor tips to resume on iOS.\n\nContrary to what I said two paragraphs above, for 7 months where tipping was\ndisabled within WeChat on iOS, WeChat on iOS was actually inferior to other\noperating systems.\n\nIt’s hard to think of a western comparison but imagine your favorite/most\nused/most important mobile app did not work well on your phone. Say you had an\niPhone and your WhatsApp, Twitter, or Email client was a really bad experience\non your phone and that problem was unique to Apple iOS. Would you consider\nswitching to a different operating system? Maybe.\n\nAs Allen Zhang said\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-and-tencent-reach-deal-to-let-wechat-users-dole-out-tips-1516018849] \nin a speech, even companies like Apple didn’t fully grasp WeChat and China:\n\n> “In the past, companies like Apple might have had a difficult time understanding\nChina-specific features,” Mr. Zhang said, according to a transcript of his\nremarks provided by Tencent. “We now all share a mutual understanding and we’ll\nsoon bring back the “tip” function.”\nSomething about that last sentence, “We now all share a mutual understanding” \nseems so subtly powerful and chilling to me. WeChat is making sure that others\nshare an understanding with them.\n\nIn many ways, mini-programs are a threat to the Apple iOS. Ben Thompson has\nwritten extensively [https://stratechery.com/company/tencent/wechat/] and\ninformed my thinking on this topic. Apple only has a 50% iPhone retention rate\nin China, whereas Apple enjoys ~80% retention for iPhones in the rest of the\nworld. iPhones are “hardware differentiated by software” and in China, the Apple\nOS software matters a lot less than in the rest of the world.\n\nLet’s look at it on a feature-by-feature level.\n\nWhat are the iPhone’s biggest lock-ins for users?\n\n * iMessage (Blue texts) – Doesn’t matter when all messaging happens over\n   WeChat. As we covered in the last issue, SMS texting was basically declared\n   dead in China in 2014 with the average Chinese person sending only about 1\n   text/day.\n * FaceTime – Doesn’t matter when all calls happen over WeChat\n * App Store – Doesn’t matter in a world of mini-programs\n * Apple Wallet/Card – Doesn’t matter with WeChat Pay\n * Services – Apple TV, Music, Arcade. Some of these might hold value, but in\n   China, you could instead use Tencent Music and play games on WeChat\n * AirPods – Ok, they’re still pretty good :) but there are no shortage of\n   cheaper knock-offs in China\n\nHere are some statistics\n[https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-tencents-wechat-poses-creeping-threat-to-apple] \nfrom The Information and Sensor Tower showing app growth decline in China:\n\n> At the same time, the number of iOS apps downloaded in China in 2019 has fallen\n12% from a peak of 9.3 billion in 2017, according to Sensor Tower. That compares\nwith an increase of 22% to 7.1 billion apps downloaded in the U.S. over the same\nperiod. And developers are making fewer new apps for iPhone users in China. The\nnumber of iOS apps available in China as of February was down 20% from a peak of\n1.84 million in 2018, Chinese government data shows. Meanwhile, App Store\nrevenue growth in China has slowed to 11% in 2019 from triple-digit growth rates\nin 2015 and 2016, according to analytics firm App Annie.\nMobile, Mobile, Mobile\nI remember the first time I ever saw the WeChat app was in college. The girl\nnext to me had the desktop app up and it was the ugliest Mac App I had ever\nseen. But to be frank, I don’t think Tencent cares that much about their desktop\nexperience. In fact, WeChat did not launch a Mac desktop app until\n[https://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/02/28/messaging-service-wechat-launches-a-native-os-x-client-making-the-mac-its-first-desktop-platform/] \n2014 and didn’t launch its Windows app until\n[https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/01/28/wechat-finally-arrives-desktop-windows-users/] \n2015.\n\nWeChat, unlike many Western apps I use, has a notably worse desktop experience\nthan mobile experience because the app is meant for mobile consumption. The\ndesktop version doesn’t include mini-programs, moments, payments, or any of the\nother features that make WeChat so powerful. The desktop app is simply, a\nmessaging client.\n\nCopy, Copy, Copy\nWhile writing part one. I changed my view on how ‘innovative’ WeChat actually\nis.\n\nI was pretty surprised writing part one how many of their features they copied\nfrom other companies, their own prior products, or from Alipay. For example:\n\n * Red envelopes, WeChat’s hack to getting users to sign up for payments was\n   created years earlier by Alipay.\n * Allen was inspired to build a mobile messaging app while watching Kik’s\n   global usage explode.\n * The voice note idea that catalyzed WeChat’s early growth came from copying \n   Talkbox\n * The idea for drift bottle came from QQ, Tencent’s desktop messaging app\n * Jump Jump game that went viral with mini-games looks to have been largely\n   copied from Ubisoft\n   [https://www.scmp.com/tech/china-tech/article/2128364/tencent-gets-china-hopping-wechats-jump-jump-game-goes-viral]\n\nAnd this leads to my next observation…\n\nTencent and Seizing the means of…distribution?\nTencent does a lot of things really well. At the top of that list is investing\nin other companies, especially those that are core to the WeChat ecosystem.\n\nHere are some of the third-party apps prominently featured on WeChat’s “WeChat\nPay” tab\n\nCan you guess what’s in common about all of the companies powering these\nservices? In most cases, Tencent is one of the company’s largest shareholders.\n\n * Didi (Ride-Hailing) – As covered in part one, Tencent owns ~20% of Didi.\n * JD.com (Specials) – Tencent owns\n   [https://fintel.io/so/us/jd/tencent-holdings] ~17% of JD, a ~$100bn+ public\n   company\n * Moguejie (Women’s Fashion) – Tencent owned 17.2% at the time of Mogu’s 2018\n   IPO\n * Zhuan Zhuan (Used Goods) – Tencent led\n   [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/58com-announces-agreement-to-raise-us200-million-from-tencent-for-the-development-of-used-goods-trading-platform-zhuan-zhuan-300440606.html] \n   a $200M round in 2017\n * Ke.com – (Housing) – Tencent led a $800M round in 2019\n * Pinduoduo (Buy Together) – Tencent owned 18.5%\n   [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737806/000104746918005204/a2236308z424b4.htm#bG10401A_main_toc] \n   at the time of the IPO. Tencent first invested in PDD in February of 2017 and\n   added them onto the WeChat Pay page in February 2018\n\nFrom Pinduoduo’s IPO prospectus, their relationship with Tencent is listed in\ntheir risk factors\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737806/000104746918005204/a2236308z424b4.htm#bG10401A_main_toc]\n:\n\n> Tencent provides services to us in connection with various aspects of our\noperations. If such services become limited, restricted, curtailed or less\neffective or more expensive in any way or become unavailable to us for any\nreason, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nFrom Mogu’s IPO prospectus\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1743971/000119312518323796/d581030df1.htm]\n:\n\n> We collaborate with Tencent, one of our principal shareholders, on various\naspects of our business, including the entryways on its platform serving as one\nof the major access points to our platform, as well as services such as payment\nprocessing, marketing and cloud technology. If services provided by Tencent to\nus become limited, compromised, restricted, curtailed or less effective or\nbecome more expensive or unavailable to us for any reason, our business may be\nmaterially and adversely affected. Failure to maintain our relationship with\nTencent could materially and adversely affect our business and results of\noperations. In addition, we may experience a decline in user traffic if\nTencent’s platform becomes less popular, which may have a material and adverse\nimpact on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWow!\n\nTencent/WeChat has two things going for it on the point of distribution.\n\n 1. Distribution allows you to enter a market later (e.g., walkie talkie second,\n    payment years after Alipay, red envelopes after Alipay, etc.).\n 2. Tencent uses it’s ubiquity in China to play the role of a kingmaker. Passing\n    up an investment from Tencent means they’ll probably invest in your\n    competitor, integrate them deeper into WeChat / WeChat Pay, and you will be\n    left behind.\n\nWeChat is built on the shoulders (and graves) of many other companies and\nproducts.\n\nOn that note, it’s tough to imagine WeChat succeeding without Tencent. 3 parts\nto that argument\n\n 1. Some of WeChat’s earliest growth came from leveraging the QQ social graph to\n    port users over to WeChat\n 2. WeChat has been able to focus on making a well-loved product (minimize ads,\n    not focus on screen time, etc.) because profitability has been less urgent\n    as they can rely on the backing of Tencent (Note: WeChat/WeChat Pay is now a\n    huge part of Tencent’s future and revenue, but was not in early days)\n 3. Many of the deep integrations and “king making” is as a result of Tencent’s\n    balance sheet. WeChat would not have been able to buy billion-dollar stakes\n    in companies as a standalone company themselves. It’s interesting to think\n    about WhatsApp through this lens as well, where if Facebook does things\n    right, WhatsApp: Facebook as WeChat: Tencent.\n\nAllen Zhang\n(Source\n[https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-tencents-wechat-poses-creeping-threat-to-apple]\n)What is WeChat without Allen Zhang?\n\nWhen Allen was promoted to VP at Tencent. Tencent’s CEO said\n[https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2012-01-13/11256636131_3.shtml] of Allen, \"He is\nvery spiritual in terms of products.\"\n\nAllen has an incredibly strong love of ‘product’, with a former colleague\nsaying,\n\n> “In essence, Zhang Xiaolong [Allen Zhang] believes in the product itself, and\nmarketing is second. This can be concluded from his attitude towards marketing:\nhe will tell the marketing staff very directly that only a good product is true.\nOthers are just icing on the cake.”\nAfter the acquisition of Zhang’s first company, Foxmail, Zhang was asked about\ncommercializing the software and his deep respect of product showed\n[https://tech.sina.com.cn/c/2001-08-24/5372.html],\n\n> “The commercialization of free software is a step that must be considered. But\nit does not mean that the free software must be commercialized. There are many\nways to develop it. Free software. We prefer to use foxmail's brand and\ntechnical advantages to develop mail servers, etc. to make money. Sometimes a\ngood free software, the value of which is to be considered in the long run,\nlet's say foxmail, we think that mail is an Internet application. The important\npiece, we will continue to develop it, just like why Microsoft invested so much\nin free IE. \"\nA similar sentiment came across when he was describing\n[http://expatadvisorscommunity.com.au/updates/story-of-zhang-xiaolong-founder-of-wechat/] \nWeChat, saying that he thought of WeChat as a car, a tool used to get to a\ndestination, but not the destination in itself. He wanted people to use WeChat\nto complete their tasks (communicate with others, share an update, get a taxi),\nbut he didn’t want WeChat to be ‘the destination’.\n\nCompared to an app like Facebook with relatively low ‘usefulness’, WeChat lists\nits second principle as usefulness.\n\n(Source\n[https://blog.wechat.com/2019/03/18/what-is-wechats-dream-wechat-founder-allen-zhang-explains/]\n)Reading about WeChat, it does seem that the design of the product has the same\n‘key man risk’ that Apple had with Steve Jobs and then Jony Ive. Decision making\nat WeChat is very top-down, where yes, Allen encourages ideas from the team, but\nthe final decision for everything related to the product rests on his shoulders.\nAs is described\n[https://hbr.org/2019/10/the-kind-of-creative-thinking-that-fueled-wechats-success] \nin a good HBR article:\n\n> As Allen Zhang told us: “We encourage people who present their own way of\nthinking – I encourage them to speak out.” But at the same time, it is clear\nthat he makes all the key decisions himself.  As his colleagues explained, they\nsubmit new features to him for approval, and he decides on the icon, the\nnickname, and other key aspects of the user experience. Developers are keenly\naware that the biggest challenge is how to ‘get past Allen’, and that many\nseemingly good features are vetoed by him.\nWeChat is an intuition led (not KPI\n[https://a16z.com/2019/02/05/allen-zhang-wechat-product-principles/] led)\nproduct. This stands in opposition to the Facebook metric-driven-growth\nphilosophy. The western consumer apps that were historically most product-led\nwere Snapchat and Instagram (less so now given FB acquisition and founders\nleaving).\n\nIn 2019, at the annual WeChat conference (like an Apple product launch event),\nAllen delivered a well-documented 4-hour speech. It gives great insight into his\nphilosophy and was translated into English here\n[https://blog.wechat.com/2019/03/18/what-is-wechats-dream-wechat-founder-allen-zhang-explains/]\n. One line that sticks,\n\n> “Think for a second, how much time do you spend on WeChat every day? Do you\nspend more time with your closest family and friends, or with WeChat? If WeChat\nwas a person, certainly it would be your best friend, that’s why you’re willing\nto spend so much time on it.”\n(Source [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-EzxRXmRiE])Closing\nIt’s interesting to think about what’s next for WeChat. Since WeChat has not\nbeen able to expand internationally and become the OS for another country in the\nway that it has for China, it’s inevitable that future monetization will not\ncome from new users, but from adding more features for and getting more out of\nexisting users.\n\nAs TechCrunch [https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/the-next-phase-of-wechat/] \npoints out, even though WeChat’s monthly active user figures are staggering,\nWeChat’s year-over-year growth is now approaching single-digit percentages. This\nis to be expected as they’re probably at or near peak saturation in China and\ntheir international expansion has not gone well.\n\nOne thing is for sure, WeChat has influenced LOTS of other technology company\nfounders and we will see companies attempting to copy its strategies for years\nto come.

Although artificial intelligence has been in the works for decades, it was not until the late 90s that machine learning started to become a part of our everyday lives. With the advent of Google, machine learning and algorithms became an integral and irremovable part of day-to-day activities in the internet-age. The investing community has not been untouched by the influence of machine learning and artificial intelligence either. While the totality of the effect of machine learning and artificial intelligence on investing is near impossible to accurately measure, I believe that that the current impact of artificial intelligence on investing has already begun to take effect in small (and quickly growing) sophisticated investing circles and that the long-term effects – as this technology continues to develop – will change the entire way that we think about investing and markets. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"First, it helps to define the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning. Although I use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) somewhat interchangeably, there is a difference between the two terms. Artificial intelligence can loosely be broken up into three categories: Artificial Narrow Intelligence (Weak AI), Artificial General Intelligence (Strong AI) and Artificial Superintelligence (The villains in action movies).  In the simplest form, machine learning is a division of artificial intelligence that is currently the most developed and the most commercialized branch of AI. Machine learning falls into the lowest tier of AI, as a weak form of artificial intelligence. Weak AI can be used to do only one function (identify your face on Facebook photos, self-driving cars, trading algorithms, etc.). Strong (general) AI, can perform several broad functions, can pass for a human (pass a turing test), and can potentially display human-level consciousness. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It's also useful to make a distinction between how this new AI/ML enabled trading existing quantitative trading methods.

Being that the most sophisticated algorithms are employed by hedge funds, who pride themselves on secrecy, most of the commentary is educated speculation from journalists and industry insiders.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"While limited details are available, Bloomberg published a lengthy \"],[0,[1],1,\"piece\"],[0,[],0,\" on “The Medallion Fund”, which is an employee only fund for those at Renaissance Technologies that utilizes several artificial intelligence technologies.

That’s \"],[0,[2],1,\"more than\"],[0,[],0,\" seven times the average annual gain for the S&P 500.” Renaissance is interested in hiring scientists, a belief rooted in the very founding of the firm. Much of the firm’s original hires, and still a strong base of RenTech employees, hail from the computing giant, IBM. Much of the original Renaissance team was working on problems including “speech recognition and machine translation […] The group’s work eventually paved the way for Google Translate and Apple’s Siri.”  While the exact extent of Renaissance’s use of AI/ML cannot be pinpointed, it is evident that they employ more AI technology than the average firm and in turn, book returns as high as 7x above the S&P 500. \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Another example of an established hedge fund turning to machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies comes from Bridgewater Associates (largest hedge fund in terms of assets under management).

[…] The programs will learn as markets change and adapt to new information, as opposed to those that follow static instructions.” \"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Ray Dalio has cited that a lot of the success of Bridgewater comes from (among many other things) the diverse history of its associates and in his mind, their extensive experience in studying markets. Ray Dalio felt that his knowledge on the effect of interconnected macroeconomic events, allowed him to make trades from information that others might ignore. With the rise of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the mass amounts of data available for consumption, he is now able to run that process on a machine/algorithm that can learn at rates exponentially faster than he could have ever dreamed for himself.

With the advent of Google, machine learning and algorithms became an integral and irremovable part of day-to-day activities in the internet-age. The investing community has not been untouched by the influence of machine learning and artificial intelligence either. While the totality of the effect of machine learning and artificial intelligence on investing is near impossible to accurately measure, I believe that that the current impact of artificial intelligence on investing has already begun to take effect in small (and quickly growing) sophisticated investing circles and that the long-term effects – as this technology continues to develop – will change the entire way that we think about investing and markets. </p><p>First, it helps to define the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning. Although I use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) somewhat interchangeably, there is a difference between the two terms. Artificial intelligence can loosely be broken up into three categories: Artificial Narrow Intelligence (Weak AI), Artificial General Intelligence (Strong AI) and Artificial Superintelligence (The villains in action movies).  In the simplest form, machine learning is a division of artificial intelligence that is currently the most developed and the most commercialized branch of AI. Machine learning falls into the lowest tier of AI, as a weak form of artificial intelligence. Weak AI can be used to do only one function (identify your face on Facebook photos, self-driving cars, trading algorithms, etc.). Strong (general) AI, can perform several broad functions, can pass for a human (pass a turing test), and can potentially display human-level consciousness. </p><p>It's also useful to make a distinction between how this new AI/ML enabled trading existing quantitative trading methods. Motoyuki Sato of Man Group Japan, Ltd. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-21/hedge-fund-robot-outsmarts-human-master-as-ai-passes-brexit-test\">sums</a> it up best, </p><blockquote>“While they both rely on computers to make investment decisions; AI programs go a step further than quant software by attempting to improve themselves over time – mimicking the human brain’s capacity for learning.” </blockquote><p>While, high-frequency trading firms (HFT) utilize automated and algorithmic trading strategies, my general impression of current HFT techniques is that they follow more of a tracking of large block trades in which they can capitalize on price swings, rather than cross-examining data to develop their own ideas of correlations between seemingly unrelated factors. </p><p>An example of “develop[ing] their own ideas” comes from Renaissance Technologies <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-21/how-renaissance-s-medallion-fund-became-finance-s-blackest-box\">where</a>, “By studying cloud cover data, they [Medallion Fund traders] found a correlation between sunny days and rising markets from New York to Tokyo. “It turns out that when it’s cloudy in Paris, the French market is less likely to go up than when it’s sunny in Paris,” he [Peter Brown] said.” </p><p>In the current investing ecosystem, it is tough to get an accurate read of the effect of machine learning and artificial intelligence on the investing world. Being that the most sophisticated algorithms are employed by hedge funds, who pride themselves on secrecy, most of the commentary is educated speculation from journalists and industry insiders.</p><p>While limited details are available, Bloomberg published a lengthy <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-21/how-renaissance-s-medallion-fund-became-finance-s-blackest-box\">piece</a> on “The Medallion Fund”, which is an employee only fund for those at Renaissance Technologies that utilizes several artificial intelligence technologies. Per Bloomberg, Renaissance’s Medallion Fund has, “generated average annual returns of 71.8 percent, before fees, from 1994 through mid-2014. That’s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-07/jim-simons-has-a-killer-flash-boy-app-and-you-can-t-have-it\">more than</a> seven times the average annual gain for the S&amp;P 500.” Renaissance is interested in hiring scientists, a belief rooted in the very founding of the firm. Much of the firm’s original hires, and still a strong base of RenTech employees, hail from the computing giant, IBM. Much of the original Renaissance team was working on problems including “speech recognition and machine translation […] The group’s work eventually paved the way for Google Translate and Apple’s Siri.”  While the exact extent of Renaissance’s use of AI/ML cannot be pinpointed, it is evident that they employ more AI technology than the average firm and in turn, book returns as high as 7x above the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>Another example of an established hedge fund turning to machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies comes from Bridgewater Associates (largest hedge fund in terms of assets under management). In February of 2015, Bridgewater <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-27/bridgewater-is-said-to-start-artificial-intelligence-team\">shared</a>: </p><blockquote>“will start a new, artificial intelligence unit next month with about half a dozen people, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The team will report to David Ferrucci, who joined Bridgewater at the end of 2012 after leading the International Business Machines (IBM) Corp. engineers that developed Watson, the computer that beat human players on the television quiz show Jeopardy! […] The programs will learn as markets change and adapt to new information, as opposed to those that follow static instructions.” </blockquote><p>Ray Dalio has cited that a lot of the success of Bridgewater comes from (among many other things) the diverse history of its associates and in his mind, their extensive experience in studying markets. Ray Dalio felt that his knowledge on the effect of interconnected macroeconomic events, allowed him to make trades from information that others might ignore. With the rise of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the mass amounts of data available for consumption, he is now able to run that process on a machine/algorithm that can learn at rates exponentially faster than he could have ever dreamed for himself. As noted above when looking at the effect of the weather in Paris and stock trading, machines can process and find correlation between events that humans would never have had the intuition to connect or resources to study. What may have taken Ray Dalio years of studying history, markets, and two degrees from Harvard, could be learned without human bias by a super computer in a mere fraction of the time.

With the rise of machine learning,\nartificial intelligence, and the mass amounts of data available for consumption,\nhe is now able to run that process on a machine/algorithm that can learn at\nrates exponentially faster than he could have ever dreamed for himself. As noted\nabove when looking at the effect of the weather in Paris and stock trading,\nmachines can process and find correlation between events that humans would never\nhave had the intuition to connect or resources to study. What may have taken Ray\nDalio years of studying history, markets, and two degrees from Harvard, could be\nlearned without human bias by a super computer in a mere fraction of the time. I\nwon’t attempt to put an exact estimate on the speed at which an artificially\nintelligent computer program could become more intelligent than a human, but as\nwriter, Tim Urban, points out\n[https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html] in a\nhypothetical (and potentially exaggerated) situation is: \n\n> “It takes decades for the first AI system to reach low-level general\nintelligence, but it finally happens. A computer is able to understand the world\naround it as well as a human four-year-old. Suddenly, within an hour of hitting\nthat milestone, the system pumps out the grand theory of physics that unifies\ngeneral relativity and quantum mechanics, something no human has been able to\ndefinitively do. 90 minutes after that, the AI has become an ASI [Artificial\nSuperintelligence], 170,000 times more intelligent than a human.”\nReturning to the topic of investments, I find it hard for any individual to\ncompete with a machine of that caliber. As a testament to how effective and\nprofitable this method of trading is, there are also several other prominent\nhedge funds getting involved in the science or whose founders have roots in\nartificial intelligence. \n\nOther examples of large hedge funds include firms like: \n\n * Two Sigma Investments. One of the Two Sigma founders, David Siegel, earned a\n   PhD in computer science from MIT where he studied in its artificial\n   intelligence lab. David Siegel was also recently hailed algorithms saying\n   [https://www.twosigma.com/insights/financial-times-op-ed-by-david-siegel-bias-against-algorithms]\n   , “that common biases against algorithms are frequently irrational, given\n   humans’ own susceptibility to making mistakes. And that the sooner we come to\n   terms with the power and potential benefits of algorithms, he writes, the\n   better off we’ll be.” \n * D. E. Shaw & Company – Founded by David E. Shaw in 1988, after he completed a\n   PhD in computer science at Stanford, joined the Columbia University computer\n   science department and then eventually left to pursue interests in\n   computational finance. \n * Simplex Asset Management – One fund run by Yoshinori Nomura, who has a\n   master’s degree in Physics, also uses AI technology to trade. Yoshinori has\n   [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-21/hedge-fund-robot-outsmarts-human-master-as-ai-passes-brexit-test] \n   “three patents to his name, including an algorithm designed to predict hit\n   songs in pop-obsessed Japan.” \n * Point72 Asset Management – Steven Cohen’s fund, is also \"building out their\n   big data investing division with several hires that will increase the firms\n   quantitative reach.\" While the article\n   [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-10/cohen-s-firm-said-to-hire-30-seeking-edge-in-public-data] \n   does not directly cite artificial intelligence/machine learning, it can be\n   reasonably assumed. Steven Cohen has also funded\n   [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-06/first-pile-of-steven-cohen-cash-is-injected-into-quantopian-code] \n   a crowdsourced algorithmic trading fund, Quantopian. \n\nStart-ups enabling artificial intelligence/machine learning investing:\n\n * Kensho Technologies – “Kensho is out to shake-up the financial data industry\n   (now dominated by Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters) by giving the masses the\n   type of complex, quantitative computer power currently used by a few top\n   hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates, D. E. Shaw and Renaissance\n   Technologies”. Goldman Sachs, Google, and the CIA are all investors (among\n   others\n   [http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2014/11/24/goldman-sachs-leads-15-million-investment-in-tech-start-up-kensho/#63d34a0b5795]\n   ).\n * Rebellion Research [https://www.rebellionresearch.com/] – “We use our\n   proprietary artificial intelligence based Machine Learning powered system to\n   operate multiple strategies for our clients. Our technology was once\n   available only to very high net worth investors through our hedge fund, but\n   is now offered to you through managed brokerage accounts at Interactive\n   Brokers.” \n * Sentient [http://www.sentient.ai/sentient-investment-management/] – “Led by\n   senior executives from both Wall Street and Silicon Valley, Sentient\n   Investment Management is developing and applying proprietary quantitative\n   trading and investment strategies built using the Sentient Technologies\n   distributed artificial intelligence system, the most powerful system of its\n   kind.”  Per Bloomberg\n   [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-14/highbridge-seeks-artificial-intelligence-edge-with-sentient]\n   , Sentient is also working with Highbridge Capital Management to “develop\n   investing strategies using artificial intelligence.” \n * Aidyia [http://aidyia.com/] – “Founded in Hong Kong in 2011 by computer\n   scientists and financial market veterans. We deploy cutting edge artificial\n   general intelligence (AGI) technology to identify patterns and predict price\n   movements.” \n * Other notable\n   [http://www.nanalyze.com/2016/08/artificial-intelligence-algorithmic-trading/] \n   AI-enabled algorithmic trading startups include: Clone Algo, Alpaca, Walnut\n   Algorithms, and Binatix.\n\nAll the research above shows that large and successful hedge funds are hiring\nthe individuals needed to capitalize on AI-enabled trading strategies.\nAdditionally, as Goldman Sachs has shown with their significant investment in\nthe MIT/Harvard start-up, Kensho, there is no shortage of startups with strong\nAI/ML capabilities, that are ripe for investment or whose proprietary software\ncan be acquired by large financial institutions.\n\nIn an opinion piece\n[https://medium.com/enrique-dans/artificial-intelligence-is-the-new-digital-divide-736cd52fe906#.pu3qlc91i] \nfrom a Spanish professor, Enrique Dans, he makes the point that as more and more\ncompanies adopt AI-enabled technology, there will be a new “Darwinian event”\nthat puts Ai-enabled companies at a level of competitiveness significantly above\ncompanies that do not utilize AI.   I believe that this era is already upon us.\nThe hedge funds cited above who use or are seriously developing their\nAI-capabilities are all behemoths in the field who have provided their investors\nwith above average returns for many years. In line with Professor Dans’s point\nabove, I believe that in the short term or until a critical mass of investors\n(hedge funds, trading desks, some level of individual investor) have access to\nAI-technology for trading, there will be a tough to reconcile advantage for\nfirms who utilize this new technology. \n\nIn the long-term, this poses even graver consequences for traders and investors.\nThe inevitable consequence of Ai technology on investing is purely (in the sense\nthat 6% unemployment = full employment) efficient markets. As more and more\ntrading is done by institutional investors (investors with the capabilities to\nafford advanced AI-technology), it will become near impossible for a\nnon-institutional or fundamental trader to make any money in the markets\n(assuming he could now to begin with). \n\nOne of the first hypothesis I had as to how the widespread implementation of\nartificial intelligence would affect trading, was that it would force us to\nredefine the efficient market hypothesis and, a level deeper, how we think about\nefficient market. Tshilidzi Marwala\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tshilidzi_Marwala] is a PhD out of South Africa\nwho, is one of the only individuals who have delved into this topic. His\nspecific research interests include, “the theory and application of\ncomputational intelligence to engineering, computer science, finance, economics,\nsocial science and medicine.”\n\nWhile, I have not yet been able to read his entire book on “Impact of Artificial\nIntelligence on Economic Theory”, I read the abstract summary of some of his\nwork. In short, Dr. Marwala, along with several Quora writers\n[https://www.quora.com/Will-AI-Algorithms-put-an-end-to-the-stock-market] have\nagreed that the rise of artificial intelligence technologies will have a \nprofound impact [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1509/1509.01213.pdf] on\neconomic theory as we know it today.  As information is more readily and\naccurately shared through computers, and as intelligent machines are able to\ninitiate trades free of human delay and bias, markets will become more\nefficient. More of a theory (and ironic consequence) I think would come hand in\nhand with this increase in efficiency, would be a decreased in the need for\nactive money managers as it becomes evident there is very little alpha to be\nmade in the markets. \n\nAnother affect this will have on the investment process is that it will continue\nto change the type of individuals that money managers look to hire. As the cost\nand ability to achieve accurate predictions deceases while the accuracy\nincreases, investment firms will have less and less of a desire to hire\nprofessionals from the finance realm (as Renaissance Technologies has already\ndemonstrated). Instead, with accurate predictions costing less than ever before,\nfirms should be more interested in bringing in individuals who are specialists\nin diverse fields to help investors identify large macro trends to look for or\nto be able to provide commentary on various industries beyond\n[https://hbr.org/2016/11/the-simple-economics-of-machine-intelligence] the role\nof an internal bank analyst.  For example, investors could enter into short-term\nconsulting contracts with geologists, climate experts, and other obscure\nacademic studies to pick their brains on freak occurrences in their industries\nand then back test their theories against the history of the markets to search\nfor correlations. \n\nAll in all, continuous advancements in computing power, sophistication, and the\ndevelopment of computer intelligence, will have a paramount impact on economic\ntheory and how we think about investing. As we look towards the future of the\nfinancial industry, it is a good time to study computer science. My prediction\nis that the start-up companies involved in developing artificially intelligent\ntrading algorithms will receive a hotbed of funding over the next few years and\nwill upset institutional money managers in profound ways until they can either\ndevelop algorithms of their own or make significant acquisitions. Additionally,\nbeyond the efficient market hypothesis, we believe there are several economic\ntheories that we will be forced to rethink. As information becomes more readily\navailable and less flawed, we will find ourselves in a very objective and\nefficient world of investing with limited returns for professional investors.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1504639725590-34d0984388bd?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-08-19T13:49:30.000Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T14:30:23.000Z","published_at":"2017-04-11T14:28:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"5f3d3c82ed2d44003924f4b3","uuid":"1ad4d0db-5b65-4a84-b920-1b59dab5a0f2","title":"In Defense of High Prices for Cancer Drugs:\nA Study on why Cancer Drugs Prices Remain so High","slug":"drug-pricing","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/business/a-huge-overnight-increase-in-a-drugs-price-raises-protests.html\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aryADm3-pHWXqgYlg9Snn58la9ylB2zw/view?usp=sharing\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"In college, I took an excellent course called about the \\\"Politics and Policy of Cancer Research.\\\"\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I was one of the only people in the class without a medical background and as a result, took a much different lens to a lot of the topics we discussed.

But as\nlong as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still\ndancing”\nFour months later, Chuck would step down due to poor financial performance\nrelated to collateralized debt obligation and mortgage-backed security-related\nlosses. Fourteen months later, Lehman would file for bankruptcy, catalyzing the \ngreat recession\n[https://bankless.substack.com/p/3-things-defi-can-learn-from-the].\n\nIt feels impossible given everything that’s happened since June, but it has been\njust over two months since $COMP went live on June 15 which really kickstarted\nthe current wave of yield farming.\n\nTo a degree, it is too early to tell whether or not Yield Farming will drive\nlasting protocol growth. But, we bet that for most projects, it’s not\nsustainable.\n\nYield farming still has many open questions including when rewards dry up or\nasymptote off: Do customers continue to use the protocol? Or does AUM flow to\nthe next new shiny thing?\n\nThere is no shortage of examples of companies paying users to use their product\nor discounting their product so heavily that users rush to it, only to leave\nonce the incentives dry up.\n\nFrom a high level, yield farming is a way for a project to incentivize an action\nby increasing the return or decreasing the cost of the action via subsidies.\n\nIn general these subsidies are paid via the project’s native token.\n\nOne of the differences between yield farming and previous incentivization\nschemes is that the incentives from yield farming are not paid with an existing\ncurrency (e.g,. ETH, USDT). Instead, DeFi projects can write a few lines of code\nand issue tens of millions or even billions worth of tokens that the market will\nhopefully ascribe some value to.\n\nTaking this even further, in many cases, these tokens lack any value capture\nmechanisms, like using a percentage of fees to buy and burn the token or even\npay a dividend. The norm is to release a token with zero intrinsic value and\nonly represents governance rights over the protocol.\n\nSo is this the best way to approach this?\n\nLet’s walk through some examples of incentive mechanisms that have been\nattempted in crypto and then get more granular on DeFi-specific case studies.\n\nGemini and GUSD\nA straightforward example of incentives gone wrong comes from stablecoin issuer\nGemini ($GUSD). In January of 2019, as GUSD was near its all-time high, The\nBlock\n[https://www.theblockcrypto.com/daily/6352/gemini-gave-trading-firms-a-stablecoin-discount-and-it-caused-big-headaches-for-one-of-its-rivals] \nwrote:\n\n> To spur adoption, Gemini offered their Gemini dollar to some over-the-counter\ntrading desks at a discount - meaning each $1 token could be bought for less\nthan a dollar. However, traders spotted an arbitrage opportunity in the deal\nwhere they could buy the discounted GUSD and then exchange it for Paxos\nStandard, Paxos' stable coin, at the full dollar price - pocketing the\ndifference.\nAs rebates dried up, so did GUSD’s market cap.\n\nGUSD’s death spiral is almost literally a case of what Bill Gurley of Benchmark\nCapital refers to\n[https://abovethecrowd.com/2011/05/24/all-revenue-is-not-created-equal-the-keys-to-the-10x-revenue-club/] \nas selling “$1 for $0.85”. Bill writes:\n\n> What if I had a business where I sold dollars for $0.85? What would my revenue\ngrowth look like? Obviously, you could grow this business to $ billions in\nrevenue tomorrow. While this may be tongue in cheek, the real-world example of\nthe “dollar for $0.85” metaphor is any business where the value transfer to\ncustomers and suppliers and employees cannot be sustained at a positive profit.\nThe customer will be thrilled with any “below market” offering and will rush in\nto get all they can. In this case, the growth was actually created by the demand\nfor the unsustainable offering.\nOne way to think about what was happening with GUSD was that people did not want\nGUSD, but they wanted the incentive that GUSD was offering.\n\nFCoin\nFCoin, founded by Huobi’s former CTO, was once the hottest exchange in crypto.\nAs far as we can tell, they brought the concept of “transaction fee mining” to\nthe crypto ecosystem. Transaction fee mining was like Yield Farming V1 (but way\nmore centralized and scammy).\n\nFCoin distributed 51% of its native tokens (“FT”) to users as a way to reimburse\ntheir trading transaction fees. FCoin incentivized users to transact frequently\nsince the platform reimbursed 100% of the transaction fees that users paid with\nFT tokens. 80% of the exchange’s daily revenue from transaction fees were paid\nback to users in the form of FT tokens.\n\nIn the FT white paper\n[https://www.allcryptowhitepapers.com/fcoin-token-whitepaper/] (which belongs in\na cryptocurrency history museum) they described this process as:\n\n> “Most importantly, FCoin has pioneered the “Trans-Fee mining” model, in which\nmore than half of the platform’s total FTs will be rewarded to the community’s\nusers to offset 100% of their transaction costs. In an unprecedented fashion,\nthe FCoin community will distribute 80% of its revenue to FT holders.”\nThis trading scheme made FCoin, at one point, the highest volume exchange in\ncrypto.\n\nIn practice, what happened with transaction fee mining was that you were\nparticipating in an “indirect ICO” (or as Binance Founder CZ called it at the\ntime, a “disguised ICO\n[https://news.8btc.com/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-fcoins-trading-is-mining-is-a-disguised-ico]\n”).\n\nIn a typical ICO, you exchange BTC or ETH for the ICO token, usually at a fixed\nratio. With FCoin, you were trading on their exchange, maybe something like the\nBTC/USDT pair, you paid your fee in USDT, and then received FCoin tokens (“FT”)\nin return. So you were giving away a token with actual value—USDT—and getting a\nnew, arbitrary token in exchange.\n\nIn practice, what caused this scheme to fail was that FCoin was minting new\ntokens every day to pay out the dividends, in turn increasing supply. While the\nmania drove an initial price spike, eventually FT crashed because of (\noversimplification here) too much supply.\n\nThis constant inflation decreased the token value for existing holders, giving\nholders more of an incentive to sell as soon as they received the FT dividend.\n\nDeFi\nEncouraging an active community via voting rights isn’t anything new. MKR has\nbeen doing this since late 2017.\n\nPaying users in a native token to use your product isn’t entirely new\neither—FCoin failed spectacularly at this.\n\nIt’s the combination of these two things that have driven the current mania in\nDeFi.\n\nThe theoretical improvement that yield farming brings is a broader distribution\nwhere the people who actually use the protocol get to be involved in the\ndecision-making process and capture some of the financial upsides. The example\nthrown around a lot in 2017 was, “imagine if Facebook's earliest users got to\ncapture some of the value they created.”\n\nIt’s hard to disagree that this is a better state of affairs than a few VCs and\naccredited investors reaping all the rewards of something they may never use.\nHowever, as it currently stands, yield farming is ripe with perverse incentives,\nlofty valuations, big promises, and multiple layers of risk.\n\nOne well-documented set of gameable incentives comes from some of the early\nactivity on Compound following the release of $COMP.\n\nBig Players, mainly this person\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x7578e676b3706aa65a4d7b9bd621922a305552db] and\nthis one\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x964d9D1A532B5a5DaeacBAc71d46320DE313AE9C],\nexploited the BAT and ZRX markets to farm large amounts of COMP. BAT and ZRX had\nvery steep interest rate curves, meaning they generally have a higher interest\nrate than other markets at the same utilization ratio (borrows/supply).\n\nSince COMP rewards paid out according to dollars paid in interest, those two\naccounts supplied large amounts of BAT and ZRX on Compound, then borrowed BAT\nand ZRX as much as possible to drive the interest rate up.\n\nAfter they did this, they could supply their borrowed BAT and ZRX back into\nCompound, and repeat the process — this is called recursive lending. This\nprocess doesn’t provide much good for the Compound protocol either. The\nliquidity they’ve put into Compound isn’t accessible by other users, since they\nborrow back most of the liquidity they’ve supplied.\n\nCompound fixed this perverse incentive by changing the reward calculation, but\nthis is an excellent example of rewards exploitation with no benefit to the\nplatform.\n\nAnother set of incentives and promises comes from a trading opportunity that\nAlameda Research took advantage of with the Balancer Protocol. As Sam\nBankman-Fried documented on Twitter\n[https://twitter.com/SBF_Alameda/status/1275927625572036608], Alameda was able\nto game the Balancer Protocol and should have received a ton of $BAL as a\nresult. However, by decree of Discord chats, Balancer decided to enact a\nwhitelist, meaning Alameda would not receive the rewards.\n\nWhat Alameda showed here was that it would be possible to provide two assets\nthat no one would particularly want to trade between (i.e., they could provide\nrelatively little value to the protocol) while still reaping the bulk of the\nprotocol rewards.\n\nIdeally, the whitelisting decision would have happened via some sort of\ngovernance mechanism, but since at the time, BAL was only a vanilla ERC-20\ntoken, the decision had to happen in Discord.\n\nLastly, risk\nAs we covered in a prior post for Deribit Insights\n[https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/aggregation-theory-applied-to-defi/]\n, the growing complexity of yield farming incentives and DeFi’s “money legos”\nleaves users more vulnerable to hacks.\n\n> The more layers away the user is from their own money, the more likely it is for\na security flaw to exist. Additionally, it becomes more and more difficult for\naggregators to audit the entire ecosystem when things become more and more\nintertwined. The BZX hack was a great example of what happens when multiple\npieces of DeFi get mixed together.\nSadly, users do NOT look at risk enough. It’s easy to get caught up in a frenzy\nwhen you’re reading Tweets about 1,000% returns, but then you wind up further\ndown the risk spectrum, until:\n\nConclusion\nAll that said, we remain excited about everything happening in DeFi and realize\nthat right now we are probably in the “as long as the music is playing, you’ve\ngot to get up and dance” phase of yield farming.\n\nThere is certainly money to be made in the short to medium term.\n\nThe Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator goes by the simple motto\n[http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html] “Make something people want.” The same\napplies to companies in DeFi.

For example, he walks through a user looking at an eBay auction and then automatically syncing with the calendar so they could get a reminder when the auction is about to end.</p><p>Mike viewed this as a way to create lock-in for the Blackberry device. He was trying to demonstrate that <strong>only</strong> on Blackberry could you connect apps to each other, turning your calendar app or eBay app into a SuperApp with a seamless, integrated experience.</p><p>The core difference between Mike’s definition and the modern definitions is that Mike’s was hardware dependent. By using the Calendar app or eBay <strong>on a Blackberry</strong>, those apps would be ‘supercharged’.</p><p>The difference with modern Super Apps is that e.g., WeChat is hardware agnostic. In general, there aren’t notable differences between WeChat on Android and WeChat and iOS.</p><p>A modern Super App like Gojek could build their own smartphones to further integrate the Gojek experience into users’ lives, but Gojek likely views hardware as commoditized. Both Gojek and Grab’s early go-to-market strategies involved bulk buying cheap smartphones and giving them to drivers on installment plans because most of their drivers did not own smartphones. The markets that many Super Apps operate in (Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Thailand, etc.) don’t have a lot of purchasing power when it comes to smartphones.</p><p>Today, Blackberry devices are mostly a relic of history.

There is <strong>no single set path</strong> to building a Super App (i.e., you don’t <em>need</em> messaging, you don’t <em>need</em> native ridesharing):</p><ul><li>WeChat started as a messaging app within a big company and offers ridesharing via a partnership with Didi.</li><li>Gojek started as a taxi dispatcher and is only now trying to add a messaging function</li></ul><p>There are, however, several characteristics that each of the Super Apps I’ve studied have or are in the process of adding:</p><ul><li>Super Apps should be a <strong>destination</strong> on the phone. Baidu (“Google of China”) is seeing its value tank as more people are using Tencent’s WeChat for vertical searches (i.e., shopping searches start in WeChat rather than on Baidu). WeChat is a destination, you can search and purchase in the same flow, whereas Baidu is not.</li><li>Super Apps have a <strong>direct relation with their users</strong> (i.e., they don’t need a search engine for their users to find them). Budding Super Apps should be concerned with over-reliance on aggregator platforms like Google and Facebook.</li><li>The app should have at least one <strong>high open-rate</strong> service/function. WeChat started with chat (something everyone uses multiple times per day). Gojek and Grab started with ride-sharing (could be daily for some, maybe weekly for most) and added more daily use functions like news. Grab and Gojek are now also trying to add a chat functionality.</li><li>Super Apps need to <strong>own their user’s wallets</strong>. Having native payment offerings creates strong lock-in to the Super App’s ecosystem and streamlines all other offerings within the product. In my WeChat issue, I described mini-programs as <em>“a storefront built on top of a payments app, rather than a payment experience build into a website.”</em></li><li><strong>Partnerships and openness are critical.</strong> While WeChat did start several of its service lines in-house many of them come from third-party companies that they bought or invested in. One company cannot successfully build the best product for dozens of verticals.</li><li>As a result of the need for openness, it’s important that companies pursuing this strategy <strong>DO NOT have “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here#:~:text=Not%20invented%20here%20(NIH)%20is,and%20costs%2C%20such%20as%20royalties.\">Not Invented Here</a>” syndrome.</strong> Super Apps need to be okay with their partners’ apps succeeding with their ecosystem. Given things I’ve read about how Facebook has handled Instagram and WhatsApp integrations, it’s a reason to be bearish on their Super App ambitions.</li><li>Super apps need to <strong>go deep on</strong> <strong>multiple verticals. </strong>Grab doesn’t offer just a surface level financial product (e.g., a mobile wallet), they have <em>Grab Financial</em> that offers a suite of financial products from financing to insurance. I’ll touch more on this point later in this post.</li></ul><p>And one bonus characteristic:</p><ul><li>(This one is more tongue in cheek than serious) … For now, at least, Super Apps use the same design layout where the Super App <strong>home screen resembles that of your phone’s home screen. </strong>This isn’t a mandatory characteristic but is common throughout all Super Apps I’ve viewed. Below are the current or former home pages of Grab, Gojek, WeChat Pay, and Alipay. Notice that they look the same. Try searching “Paytm home screen” or “Meituan home screen”. You will find the exact same format. My guess is that one of these apps laid out this format first (I think Alipay) and then WeChat copied and then everyone copied WeChat. The more generous interpretation is that Super Apps recognize that they’re competing with your phone’s operating system (whether iOS or Android and their app stores’ apps) and they want their app home screen to resemble that of your phone home screen. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcefad633-8b3f-43e4-83b7-d8b3b664de80_936x438.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"benefits-of-superapp-dom\"><strong><strong><strong>Benefits of SuperApp-Dom</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Some potentially less obvious benefits:</p><ul><li>Super Apps have a <strong>significantly lower cost of acquisition</strong> for new users. The obvious part of this would be that if WeChat rolls out a new social function, that product is sharing the same social graph as their other apps and so porting info over or connecting accounts is easier. Where this point is less obvious is around financial products. Each time a FinTech app brings on new users they pay non-trivial costs, to multiple vendors to run know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks on new users. If a user goes through KYC/AML for Grab Wallet, they (presumably!) don’t need to go through that same KYC for Grab Insurance or lending. This decreases the cost of acquisition of new customers.</li><li>Super Apps have <strong>higher lifetime value </strong>with their users<strong>. </strong>As far back as 2015, WeChat <a href=\"https://qz.com/179007/wechat-is-nothing-like-whatsapp-and-that-makes-it-even-more-valuable/\">had</a> an average revenue per user (ARPU) of about $7, and investment banks in 2014 <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/heard-on-the-street-whatsapp-is-down-for-china-messaging-1392874502?tesla=y\">pegged</a> WeChat’s value per user (as measured by Tencent’s stock price) at ~$95/user. Likely, this number is much higher for WeChat now given that in 2015, mini-programs didn’t exist yet. As a point of comparison, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/facebook-towers-over-rivals-in-the-critical-metric-of-revenue-per-user.html#:~:text=Facebook%20is%20generating%20more%20money,highest%20ARPU%20in%20its%20history.\">Facebook’s 2019 ARPU</a> is $7.26, about what WeChat’s was in 2015.</li><li>Super Apps have a <strong>comprehensive collection of user’s data</strong>. Imagine having direct access to your users’ financial transactions, social media posts, taxi history, knowing what celebrities they follow, and a myriad of additional health and financial data. You could do a lot with that. 📞Incoming call from Cambridge Analytica📞</li></ul><h2 id=\"why-don-t-we-have-super-apps-in-the-west\"><strong><strong><strong>Why don’t we have Super Apps in the West?</strong></strong></strong></h2><blockquote><em>If you live in America, you’ve heard of Super Apps. If you live in Asia, you’ve used one.</em></blockquote><p>If you look at Europe and North America, there are no dominant Super Apps. It’s impossible to say with certainty why Super Apps aren’t common in western countries (and I’ll specifically talk about America here since it’s the country I’m most familiar with), but here are my four hypotheses:</p><p>1</p><p><strong>It’s tough to build a Super App for a country with an established internet economy</strong> (e.g., America). The current group of well-known Super Apps started in countries with underdeveloped internet economies. WeChat (China — at the time was underdeveloped), Gojek (Indonesia), Grab (Malaysia and southeast Asia), Alipay (China), Zalo (Vietnam), Paytm (India), and others.</p><p>Part of this is due to the fact that there is already such a wide selection of apps in the United States that it would be tough for one app to consolidate all of those applications’ features into one (better!) “Super App” experience.</p><p>Some of this is due to <strong>path dependency</strong>. Talking about QR codes in China, Ben Thompson <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2020/visa-plaid-follow-up-apple-v-fbi-round-2-2020-differences/\">says</a>,</p><blockquote>It is tempting to look at how payments work in countries like China<strong>, </strong>but that ignores the path dependency of one market using cash until recently, and the other receiving unsolicited Bank Americards 51 years ago<strong>.</strong> <strong>Once a job is done</strong> — and credit cards do their jobs very well — <strong>it takes a 10x improvement to get users to switch</strong>, and, in a three-sided network, that 10x is 10</blockquote><p>In the same way that the US and China are on different paths regarding payments, we’re also on different paths regarding applications and the mobile web.</p><p>Super Apps could simplistically be thought of as platform companies that are able to build out many verticals within one app. This has worked well in markets like China, Indonesia, etc. because <strong>those markets did not have strong incumbent competitors.</strong></p><p>After Gojek had a strong market position in ride-sharing, you could imagine a very MBA-like conversation happening at the company where leaders asked, “what is the next biggest TAM market that is underserved that we can cross-sell our existing user base?” From there they landed on markets like insurance, travel, medicine, and all the other many products they offer.</p><p>It’s possible that several app experiences within one app could be superior, but at this point, many in the west are okay with and have been trained to be okay switching between multiple apps for things, adding credit card info to new apps, and all the other laborious functions of adding new apps.</p><p>Uber, iMessage, and Twitter all do their individual jobs well. A new app that wants to recreate all those experiences would have a high bar to clear to get users to switch.</p><p><em>(h/t Abheek Anand for guiding my thinking <a href=\"https://disruptive.asia/super-app-talent/\">here</a>)</em></p><p>2</p><p>Super Apps are mobile experiences and <strong>most western countries are not mobile-first countries.</strong></p><p>Even though Indonesian internet usage is surging, reaching about <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/05/18/indonesia-has-171-million-internet-users-study.html\">~65% of the population in 2019</a>, only <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1084007/indonesia-share-of-population-using-a-computer-by-area/#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20approximately%2025.85%20percent,the%20internet%20is%20still%20increasing.\">about</a> 26% of the population were using a computer as of 2018.</p><p>Super Apps are primed for their mobile experiences. As far as I know, Gojek and Grab don’t offer desktop experiences. WeChat notoriously has a very stripped down and basic desktop experience (basically, just chat).</p><p>As America becomes a more mobile-first country (with younger generations leading the charge), it’s possible we could see popular consumer apps (e.g., TikTok) add Super App like functionality.</p><p>On the individual app level, what are some new apps that have taken historically desktop-based experiences and turned them into mobile experiences for younger generations? This has been prevalent throughout the FinTech industry. There’s no better example than Robinhood turning your brokerage account into a sleek mobile experience. All the challenger/neo-banks fit these criteria of taking previously clunky, desktop experiences, and turning them into sleek mobile experiences.</p><p>3.</p><p>As I proposed in my <a href=\"https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-part-2\">earlier WeChat issue</a>, <em>“To be a truly generalizable Super App, <strong>you need to own your user’s wallet</strong>.”</em></p><p>A key element of all the Super Apps I’ve previously covered is that they own or have a direct connection to users’ bank accounts. Part of this is due to the fact that in the countries these apps operate, the populations were largely unbanked or cash-dependent prior to the Super App’s solution. To some degree, companies like Gojek needed to help their users move into digital payments because it made it easier for them to process transactions. Also, compare this to the US where <a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/\">only</a> about 7% of the population is unbanked.</p><p>This explains why you see aspiring Super Apps like Facebook (via <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/media-gallery/executives/david-marcus/\">Facebook Financial</a>) or Uber (via <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/newsroom/introducing-uber-money/\">Uber Money</a>) really trying to earn their user’s deposits. But again, the problem is that many Americans are pretty satisfied with their current bank/digital wallet offerings and so there will be a high bar to get them to switch to an alternative product.</p><p>When you own your users’ deposits, benefits include:</p><ul><li>You decrease the fees associated with third party debit and credit card processor transactions.</li><li>When offering users additional financial service products (loans, margin trading), you already have a vividly clear overview of their financial health and can provide best-in-class underwriting</li><li>It decreases the barrier to users making additional transactions within your ecosystem’s products.</li></ul><p>4.</p><p>It is important that Super Apps have <strong>strong positive relations with the governments</strong> of the countries they operate within. The leaders of countries with Super Apps, seem to really love them. The Indonesian President fired a cabinet member that appeared to be anti-Gojek and then appointed Gojek’s founder to his next cabinet. You can’t get much cozier than that. Well, unless you’re Tencent (WeChat’s owner). There are countless articles talking about censorship within WeChat at the behest of the Chinese government and I believe Tencent’s top executives are also official members of the CCP (as most top company execs must be in China).</p><p>In today’s political climate, it’s challenging to imagine an American or European leader going out of their way to promote a burgeoning Super App. Look at how western democracies have treated Facebook and Uber.</p><p>As we’ve covered in prior issues, Gojek and Grab have lots of pro-nationalist marketing in which they align themselves with the growth of the companies they operate in.</p><p>From <strong><a href=\"https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/uber-v-gojek-nationalist-marketing\">Uber v. Gojek (Nationalist Marketing &amp; Gov't Relations)</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><em>Since early on, Gojek’s marketing language made strong nationalist appeals. As one example, the jackets for each country’s drivers have their national flags embroidered on them. They made an effort to align themselves with all of the countries that they operated in.</em></blockquote><p>And that’s not all just marketing. Gojek appears to make meaningful contributions to Indonesia’s GDP and has increased the standard of living for its drivers. In the case of Grab, Malaysia notoriously had one of the most dangerous taxi industries in the world. While I haven’t seen exact measurements, it’s possible they’ve also increased foreigner’s willingness to visit the country (good for tourism, small businesses, taxes, etc.).</p><p>In the case of WeChat, you could argue that the Chinese government likes most of the country’s online activity taking place within one centralized ecosystem where all of someone’s transactions and conversations are linked.</p><p>The second point related to government relations is that the US and Europe have stricter anti-trust laws than the rest of the world. If American leaders are talking about breaking up Facebook, OH BOY would they hate an app with dominance and reach like WeChat. Given both the stricter regulation in the west and the current political climate towards big tech, it is possible that regulation could be the biggest barrier to entry of a Super App ever reaching a level of influence like WeChat commands.</p><p>As I’m writing this post (September 4, 2020), the Justice Department of the USA is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21421314/justice-antitrust-google-barr-tech\">reportedly planning</a> to file an antitrust case against Google</p><h2 id=\"what-s-the-west-to-do\"><strong><strong><strong>What’s the West to do?</strong></strong></strong></h2><p>Riffing off the hypotheses from above, it’s possible that a Super App could bloom here as the US becomes more mobile-centric due to gen-z and younger generations.</p><p>Anecdotally, I (a millennial) remember desperately wanting a Mac in middle school. My 17-year old sister (Gen-Z) could care less about what computer she has (she happily uses the free Chromebook her school gives her).</p><p>While I believe it will be difficult for a Western-focused company to build a generalizable Super App (this won’t stop them from trying!), I do believe it is possible for entrepreneurs and existing companies within western markets to build powerful <em>Super Apps for X.</em></p><p>Some examples of this include</p><ul><li>Super App for Health</li><li>Super App for Finances</li><li>Super App for Travel</li></ul><p>There are a number of western apps already trying to brand themselves as a Super App.</p><p>Within the finance category, here are a few examples:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d3a2f73-5146-4955-bfe0-46f39b9516f7_940x160.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe71e3edd-8a2d-4135-b9a1-342d5c9d4b4b_936x236.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>(<a href=\"https://www.altfi.com/article/6661_revolut-launches-new-super-app-as-it-hits-12m-customers\">Source</a>)</p><p>Speaking about Revolut, another commentator <a href=\"https://www.accountingweb.co.uk/tech/tech-pulse/starling-revolut-and-monzo-the-fintech-smackdown\">said</a>:</p><blockquote>“Revolut has become an expert at shipping new products and features (loyalty, share trading, currency conversion and so on), and is now very much considered to be in the ‘super app’ category. <strong>Could they become the WeChat of the UK?”</strong></blockquote><p>My reaction:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8df04925-a37e-456a-b0e8-46280126879b_200x135.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Now, you might be reading this and saying, isn’t a “Super App for X” just a “vertically-integrated app”.

Their goal was to turn Gojek into the operating system of the phone. WeChat enjoys this luxury in China and Gojek wanted the same relationship with Indonesians and other Southeast Asian citizens. Gojek, seems to have relied more on developing services in-house than other SuperApps and this was their chance to begin branching out.”</blockquote><p><a href=\"https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/building-a-strong-superapp-ecosystem-in-southeast-asia/\">From</a> Aditi Sharma, Grab’s Director and Head of Startup Programs &amp; Investments:</p><blockquote><em>“It is clear from the beginning that doing this all by ourselves is not entirely practical. Strategically it makes more sense for us to build a healthy ecosystem of partners around our users. “Hence we are constantly seeking quality partners in the ecosystem to work with on our everyday superapp vision,”</em></blockquote><p>The evolution from a regular app to a Super App looks something like this:</p><ol><li>Build 1 killer app (WeChat: messaging) or a suite of complementary apps (Gojek: Motorcycles, taxi, delivery) <strong>in-house</strong></li><li>Do some <strong>formal BD/Partnership deals</strong> where you allow a third-party to offer their services through your app (e.g., WeChat offering ride-hailing via Didi, Gojek offering medical product delivery via Halodoc)</li><li>Have a completely open product line where <strong>ANYONE</strong> can create their own app within your app (WeChat: Mini programs)</li></ol><p>By this definition, only WeChat is a full Super App. Grab and Gojek are still on step 2, while many of the aspiring Western Super Apps are still on step 1.</p><p>For example, let’s take M1 Finance, a Chicago, USA-based company. They do offer several functions (checking account with a debit card, borrowing, investing), but all of those functions are created, managed, and offered by M1.</p><p>Let’s take a deeper look at Revolut. Going through their offerings, they include things such as: checking accounts, money transfers, stock and cryptocurrency purchasing, insurance, and other financial related transactions. While some of these might look like partnerships (Stock trading via DriveWealth, Insurance via Simplesurance), they are not in the same way that WeChat and Didi or Gojek and Halodoc are partners.</p><p>Revolut uses <a href=\"https://finovate.com/drivewealth-powers-commission-free-trading-for-revolut-cardholders/\">DriveWealth</a> to provide stock trading and uses <a href=\"https://www.simplesurance.com/\">Simplesurance</a> for their insurance products, but DriveWealth and Simplesurance are behind-the-scenes service providers.

I wanted\na better understanding of what makes Super Apps so powerful and what\ndifferentiates them from the monster FAANG apps of the west.\n\nGojek’s engineering blog provides\n[https://www.gojek.io/superapp/#:~:text=A%20Super%20App%20is%20many,for%20a%20mobile%2Dfirst%20generation] \nthe most succinct definition of a Super App,\n\n> “A Super App is many apps within an umbrella app. It’s an Operating System that\nunbundles the tyranny of apps. It’s a portal to the internet for a mobile-first\ngeneration”\nWhile these days there are many Super Apps (and many companies trying to be\nSuper Apps), the term Super App is most often associated with WeChat\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-a-not-so-brief-history], the\nmassively popular Chinese Super App. In the context of WeChat, you will often\nhear it described as the “one app to rule them all”\n\nThe \"One Ring to Rule Them All\" from Lord of the RingsWhile WeChat may have been\nthe first app to embody the principles of a modern SuperApp, the origin of the\nterm dates back to 2010.\n\nHistory\nDoes the name Mike Lazaridis mean anything to you? Mike is the founder of\nResearch in Motion (“RIM”), manufacturer of the BlackBerry device. Mike is also\nthe inventor of the concept of a Super App.\n\nIn 1999 BlackBerry debuted one of the world’s first smartphones, the BlackBerry\n850\n[https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/137319-farewell-blackberry-os-here-are-the-23-best-blackberry-phones-that-changed-the-world]\n.\n\nBy 2010, the Blackberry was on top of the world\n\n * It was the #1 smartphone in America,\n * The #2 smartphone worldwide\n * Sold more than 75 million devices\n * Had more than 200,000 registered app developers\n * Had 14,000+ employees focused on the BlackBerry.\n\nIn 2010, about half of every smartphone\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awoB1aeZFYc] shipped in the world was a\nBlackBerry device (see chart).\n\nIn a speech at Mobile World Congress 2010, Blackberry CEO, Mike Lazaridis\nintroduced the concept of a Super App.\n\nMike defined Super Apps as:\n\n> \"Super-apps are integrated with other apps, giving a seamless experience across\nthe device. They're contextual - aware of things like your location and status\"\n> “SuperApps are apps that once you start using them, you wonder how you ever\npreviously lived without them”\nOr as Crackberry.com summarizes [https://crackberry.com/what-super-app]:\n\n> “Applications which make use of all the BlackBerry resources available. […] Deep\nintegration across the whole device.”\n(While these features sound common now, this speech was in 2010 so some of these\nthings were impressive at the time.)\n\nMike was describing apps that could talk to each other. For example, he walks\nthrough a user looking at an eBay auction and then automatically syncing with\nthe calendar so they could get a reminder when the auction is about to end.\n\nMike viewed this as a way to create lock-in for the Blackberry device. He was\ntrying to demonstrate that only on Blackberry could you connect apps to each\nother, turning your calendar app or eBay app into a SuperApp with a seamless,\nintegrated experience.\n\nThe core difference between Mike’s definition and the modern definitions is that\nMike’s was hardware dependent. By using the Calendar app or eBay on a Blackberry\n, those apps would be ‘supercharged’.\n\nThe difference with modern Super Apps is that e.g., WeChat is hardware agnostic.\nIn general, there aren’t notable differences between WeChat on Android and\nWeChat and iOS.\n\nA modern Super App like Gojek could build their own smartphones to further\nintegrate the Gojek experience into users’ lives, but Gojek likely views\nhardware as commoditized. Both Gojek and Grab’s early go-to-market strategies\ninvolved bulk buying cheap smartphones and giving them to drivers on installment\nplans because most of their drivers did not own smartphones. The markets that\nmany Super Apps operate in (Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Thailand, etc.) don’t\nhave a lot of purchasing power when it comes to smartphones.\n\nToday, Blackberry devices are mostly a relic of history. While I give Mike and\nBlackberry credit for creating the term Super App, they can’t get credit for the\nvalue capture and ecosystem that modern Super Apps have built.\n\nIn the rest of this issue, we will cover:\n\n * Characteristics of Super Apps\n * Non-obvious benefits of running a Super App\n * Why we don’t have them in the west and how that could change\n\n(Side note: Surprisingly, Blackberry still did about $1bn in revenue last year,\nbut that’s down from a peak in 2011 of about $20bn).\n\n(Sources: Mike’s full Super App presentation on YouTube: Part 1\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afFa_AQ5ZKQ], Part 2\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJsIMLkFDcQ], Part 3\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-g-OpNmRIs])\n\nCharacteristics of Super Apps\nEach Super App took a unique path to become one. There is no single set path to\nbuilding a Super App (i.e., you don’t need messaging, you don’t need native\nridesharing):\n\n * WeChat started as a messaging app within a big company and offers ridesharing\n   via a partnership with Didi.\n * Gojek started as a taxi dispatcher and is only now trying to add a messaging\n   function\n\nThere are, however, several characteristics that each of the Super Apps I’ve\nstudied have or are in the process of adding:\n\n * Super Apps should be a destination on the phone. Baidu (“Google of China”) is\n   seeing its value tank as more people are using Tencent’s WeChat for vertical\n   searches (i.e., shopping searches start in WeChat rather than on Baidu).\n   WeChat is a destination, you can search and purchase in the same flow,\n   whereas Baidu is not.\n * Super Apps have a direct relation with their users (i.e., they don’t need a\n   search engine for their users to find them). Budding Super Apps should be\n   concerned with over-reliance on aggregator platforms like Google and\n   Facebook.\n * The app should have at least one high open-rate service/function. WeChat\n   started with chat (something everyone uses multiple times per day). Gojek and\n   Grab started with ride-sharing (could be daily for some, maybe weekly for\n   most) and added more daily use functions like news. Grab and Gojek are now\n   also trying to add a chat functionality.\n * Super Apps need to own their user’s wallets. Having native payment offerings\n   creates strong lock-in to the Super App’s ecosystem and streamlines all other\n   offerings within the product. In my WeChat issue, I described mini-programs\n   as “a storefront built on top of a payments app, rather than a payment\n   experience build into a website.”\n * Partnerships and openness are critical. While WeChat did start several of its\n   service lines in-house many of them come from third-party companies that they\n   bought or invested in. One company cannot successfully build the best product\n   for dozens of verticals.\n * As a result of the need for openness, it’s important that companies pursuing\n   this strategy DO NOT have “Not Invented Here\n   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here#:~:text=Not%20invented%20here%20(NIH)%20is,and%20costs%2C%20such%20as%20royalties.]\n   ” syndrome. Super Apps need to be okay with their partners’ apps succeeding\n   with their ecosystem. Given things I’ve read about how Facebook has handled\n   Instagram and WhatsApp integrations, it’s a reason to be bearish on their\n   Super App ambitions.\n * Super apps need to go deep on multiple verticals. Grab doesn’t offer just a\n   surface level financial product (e.g., a mobile wallet), they have Grab\n   Financial that offers a suite of financial products from financing to\n   insurance. I’ll touch more on this point later in this post.\n\nAnd one bonus characteristic:\n\n * (This one is more tongue in cheek than serious) … For now, at least, Super\n   Apps use the same design layout where the Super App home screen resembles\n   that of your phone’s home screen. This isn’t a mandatory characteristic but\n   is common throughout all Super Apps I’ve viewed. Below are the current or\n   former home pages of Grab, Gojek, WeChat Pay, and Alipay. Notice that they\n   look the same. Try searching “Paytm home screen” or “Meituan home screen”.\n   You will find the exact same format. My guess is that one of these apps laid\n   out this format first (I think Alipay) and then WeChat copied and then\n   everyone copied WeChat. The more generous interpretation is that Super Apps\n   recognize that they’re competing with your phone’s operating system (whether\n   iOS or Android and their app stores’ apps) and they want their app home\n   screen to resemble that of your phone home screen. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nBenefits of SuperApp-Dom\nSome potentially less obvious benefits:\n\n * Super Apps have a significantly lower cost of acquisition for new users. The\n   obvious part of this would be that if WeChat rolls out a new social function,\n   that product is sharing the same social graph as their other apps and so\n   porting info over or connecting accounts is easier. Where this point is less\n   obvious is around financial products. Each time a FinTech app brings on new\n   users they pay non-trivial costs, to multiple vendors to run\n   know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) checks on new users.\n   If a user goes through KYC/AML for Grab Wallet, they (presumably!) don’t need\n   to go through that same KYC for Grab Insurance or lending. This decreases the\n   cost of acquisition of new customers.\n * Super Apps have higher lifetime value with their users. As far back as 2015,\n   WeChat had\n   [https://qz.com/179007/wechat-is-nothing-like-whatsapp-and-that-makes-it-even-more-valuable/] \n   an average revenue per user (ARPU) of about $7, and investment banks in 2014 \n   pegged\n   [https://www.wsj.com/articles/heard-on-the-street-whatsapp-is-down-for-china-messaging-1392874502?tesla=y] \n   WeChat’s value per user (as measured by Tencent’s stock price) at ~$95/user.\n   Likely, this number is much higher for WeChat now given that in 2015,\n   mini-programs didn’t exist yet. As a point of comparison, Facebook’s 2019\n   ARPU\n   [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/facebook-towers-over-rivals-in-the-critical-metric-of-revenue-per-user.html#:~:text=Facebook%20is%20generating%20more%20money,highest%20ARPU%20in%20its%20history.] \n   is $7.26, about what WeChat’s was in 2015.\n * Super Apps have a comprehensive collection of user’s data. Imagine having\n   direct access to your users’ financial transactions, social media posts, taxi\n   history, knowing what celebrities they follow, and a myriad of additional\n   health and financial data. You could do a lot with that. 📞Incoming call from\n   Cambridge Analytica📞\n\nWhy don’t we have Super Apps in the West?\n> If you live in America, you’ve heard of Super Apps. If you live in Asia, you’ve\nused one.\nIf you look at Europe and North America, there are no dominant Super Apps. It’s\nimpossible to say with certainty why Super Apps aren’t common in western\ncountries (and I’ll specifically talk about America here since it’s the country\nI’m most familiar with), but here are my four hypotheses:\n\n1\n\nIt’s tough to build a Super App for a country with an established internet\neconomy (e.g., America). The current group of well-known Super Apps started in\ncountries with underdeveloped internet economies. WeChat (China — at the time\nwas underdeveloped), Gojek (Indonesia), Grab (Malaysia and southeast Asia),\nAlipay (China), Zalo (Vietnam), Paytm (India), and others.\n\nPart of this is due to the fact that there is already such a wide selection of\napps in the United States that it would be tough for one app to consolidate all\nof those applications’ features into one (better!) “Super App” experience.\n\nSome of this is due to path dependency. Talking about QR codes in China, Ben\nThompson says\n[https://stratechery.com/2020/visa-plaid-follow-up-apple-v-fbi-round-2-2020-differences/]\n,\n\n> It is tempting to look at how payments work in countries like China, but that\nignores the path dependency of one market using cash until recently, and the\nother receiving unsolicited Bank Americards 51 years ago. Once a job is done —\nand credit cards do their jobs very well — it takes a 10x improvement to get\nusers to switch, and, in a three-sided network, that 10x is 10\nIn the same way that the US and China are on different paths regarding payments,\nwe’re also on different paths regarding applications and the mobile web.\n\nSuper Apps could simplistically be thought of as platform companies that are\nable to build out many verticals within one app. This has worked well in markets\nlike China, Indonesia, etc. because those markets did not have strong incumbent\ncompetitors.\n\nAfter Gojek had a strong market position in ride-sharing, you could imagine a\nvery MBA-like conversation happening at the company where leaders asked, “what\nis the next biggest TAM market that is underserved that we can cross-sell our\nexisting user base?” From there they landed on markets like insurance, travel,\nmedicine, and all the other many products they offer.\n\nIt’s possible that several app experiences within one app could be superior, but\nat this point, many in the west are okay with and have been trained to be okay\nswitching between multiple apps for things, adding credit card info to new apps,\nand all the other laborious functions of adding new apps.\n\nUber, iMessage, and Twitter all do their individual jobs well. A new app that\nwants to recreate all those experiences would have a high bar to clear to get\nusers to switch.\n\n(h/t Abheek Anand for guiding my thinking here\n[https://disruptive.asia/super-app-talent/])\n\n2\n\nSuper Apps are mobile experiences and most western countries are not\nmobile-first countries.\n\nEven though Indonesian internet usage is surging, reaching about ~65% of the\npopulation in 2019\n[https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/05/18/indonesia-has-171-million-internet-users-study.html]\n, only about\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1084007/indonesia-share-of-population-using-a-computer-by-area/#:~:text=In%202018%2C%20approximately%2025.85%20percent,the%20internet%20is%20still%20increasing.] \n26% of the population were using a computer as of 2018.\n\nSuper Apps are primed for their mobile experiences. As far as I know, Gojek and\nGrab don’t offer desktop experiences. WeChat notoriously has a very stripped\ndown and basic desktop experience (basically, just chat).\n\nAs America becomes a more mobile-first country (with younger generations leading\nthe charge), it’s possible we could see popular consumer apps (e.g., TikTok) add\nSuper App like functionality.\n\nOn the individual app level, what are some new apps that have taken historically\ndesktop-based experiences and turned them into mobile experiences for younger\ngenerations? This has been prevalent throughout the FinTech industry. There’s no\nbetter example than Robinhood turning your brokerage account into a sleek mobile\nexperience. All the challenger/neo-banks fit these criteria of taking previously\nclunky, desktop experiences, and turning them into sleek mobile experiences.\n\n3.\n\nAs I proposed in my earlier WeChat issue\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-part-2], “To be a truly\ngeneralizable Super App, you need to own your user’s wallet.”\n\nA key element of all the Super Apps I’ve previously covered is that they own or\nhave a direct connection to users’ bank accounts. Part of this is due to the\nfact that in the countries these apps operate, the populations were largely\nunbanked or cash-dependent prior to the Super App’s solution. To some degree,\ncompanies like Gojek needed to help their users move into digital payments\nbecause it made it easier for them to process transactions. Also, compare this\nto the US where only [https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/] about 7% of the\npopulation is unbanked.\n\nThis explains why you see aspiring Super Apps like Facebook (via Facebook\nFinancial [https://about.fb.com/media-gallery/executives/david-marcus/]) or Uber\n(via Uber Money [https://www.uber.com/newsroom/introducing-uber-money/]) really\ntrying to earn their user’s deposits. But again, the problem is that many\nAmericans are pretty satisfied with their current bank/digital wallet offerings\nand so there will be a high bar to get them to switch to an alternative product.\n\nWhen you own your users’ deposits, benefits include:\n\n * You decrease the fees associated with third party debit and credit card\n   processor transactions.\n * When offering users additional financial service products (loans, margin\n   trading), you already have a vividly clear overview of their financial health\n   and can provide best-in-class underwriting\n * It decreases the barrier to users making additional transactions within your\n   ecosystem’s products.\n\n4.\n\nIt is important that Super Apps have strong positive relations with the\ngovernments of the countries they operate within. The leaders of countries with\nSuper Apps, seem to really love them. The Indonesian President fired a cabinet\nmember that appeared to be anti-Gojek and then appointed Gojek’s founder to his\nnext cabinet. You can’t get much cozier than that. Well, unless you’re Tencent\n(WeChat’s owner). There are countless articles talking about censorship within\nWeChat at the behest of the Chinese government and I believe Tencent’s top\nexecutives are also official members of the CCP (as most top company execs must\nbe in China).\n\nIn today’s political climate, it’s challenging to imagine an American or\nEuropean leader going out of their way to promote a burgeoning Super App. Look\nat how western democracies have treated Facebook and Uber.\n\nAs we’ve covered in prior issues, Gojek and Grab have lots of pro-nationalist\nmarketing in which they align themselves with the growth of the companies they\noperate in.\n\nFrom Uber v. Gojek (Nationalist Marketing & Gov't Relations)\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/uber-v-gojek-nationalist-marketing]:\n\n> Since early on, Gojek’s marketing language made strong nationalist appeals. As\none example, the jackets for each country’s drivers have their national flags\nembroidered on them. They made an effort to align themselves with all of the\ncountries that they operated in.\nAnd that’s not all just marketing. Gojek appears to make meaningful\ncontributions to Indonesia’s GDP and has increased the standard of living for\nits drivers. In the case of Grab, Malaysia notoriously had one of the most\ndangerous taxi industries in the world. While I haven’t seen exact measurements,\nit’s possible they’ve also increased foreigner’s willingness to visit the\ncountry (good for tourism, small businesses, taxes, etc.).\n\nIn the case of WeChat, you could argue that the Chinese government likes most of\nthe country’s online activity taking place within one centralized ecosystem\nwhere all of someone’s transactions and conversations are linked.\n\nThe second point related to government relations is that the US and Europe have\nstricter anti-trust laws than the rest of the world. If American leaders are\ntalking about breaking up Facebook, OH BOY would they hate an app with dominance\nand reach like WeChat. Given both the stricter regulation in the west and the\ncurrent political climate towards big tech, it is possible that regulation could\nbe the biggest barrier to entry of a Super App ever reaching a level of\ninfluence like WeChat commands.\n\nAs I’m writing this post (September 4, 2020), the Justice Department of the USA\nis reportedly planning\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21421314/justice-antitrust-google-barr-tech] \nto file an antitrust case against Google\n\nWhat’s the West to do?\nRiffing off the hypotheses from above, it’s possible that a Super App could\nbloom here as the US becomes more mobile-centric due to gen-z and younger\ngenerations.\n\nAnecdotally, I (a millennial) remember desperately wanting a Mac in middle\nschool. My 17-year old sister (Gen-Z) could care less about what computer she\nhas (she happily uses the free Chromebook her school gives her).\n\nWhile I believe it will be difficult for a Western-focused company to build a\ngeneralizable Super App (this won’t stop them from trying!), I do believe it is\npossible for entrepreneurs and existing companies within western markets to\nbuild powerful Super Apps for X.\n\nSome examples of this include\n\n * Super App for Health\n * Super App for Finances\n * Super App for Travel\n\nThere are a number of western apps already trying to brand themselves as a Super\nApp.\n\nWithin the finance category, here are a few examples:\n\n(Source\n[https://www.altfi.com/article/6661_revolut-launches-new-super-app-as-it-hits-12m-customers]\n)\n\nSpeaking about Revolut, another commentator said\n[https://www.accountingweb.co.uk/tech/tech-pulse/starling-revolut-and-monzo-the-fintech-smackdown]\n:\n\n> “Revolut has become an expert at shipping new products and features (loyalty,\nshare trading, currency conversion and so on), and is now very much considered\nto be in the ‘super app’ category. Could they become the WeChat of the UK?”\nMy reaction:\n\nNow, you might be reading this and saying, isn’t a “Super App for X” just a\n“vertically-integrated app”. Well, yes and no.\n\nThe difference between a Super App and a vertically integrated app is that a\nSuper app is open and allows other companies to live within its ecosystem,\nacting as a marketplace or portal, whereas a vertically integrated app is the\nowner or developer of all the apps within its ecosystem\n\nIn my Gojek article [https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/gojek] I called this\nout saying:\n\n> “When building a SuperApp (one app for many things) that integrates dozens of\nservices you can opt to build services in-house, have third-party APIs where\npeople can build their own apps, or have formal partnerships where you integrate\nanother company’s services into your app. […] In mid-2018, Gojek launched its\nthird-party platform (“TPP”) so that businesses besides Gojek could build apps\non its platform. Their goal was to turn Gojek into the operating system of the\nphone. WeChat enjoys this luxury in China and Gojek wanted the same relationship\nwith Indonesians and other Southeast Asian citizens. Gojek, seems to have relied\nmore on developing services in-house than other SuperApps and this was their\nchance to begin branching out.”\nFrom\n[https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/building-a-strong-superapp-ecosystem-in-southeast-asia/] \nAditi Sharma, Grab’s Director and Head of Startup Programs & Investments:\n\n> “It is clear from the beginning that doing this all by ourselves is not entirely\npractical. Strategically it makes more sense for us to build a healthy ecosystem\nof partners around our users. “Hence we are constantly seeking quality partners\nin the ecosystem to work with on our everyday superapp vision,”\nThe evolution from a regular app to a Super App looks something like this:\n\n 1. Build 1 killer app (WeChat: messaging) or a suite of complementary apps\n    (Gojek: Motorcycles, taxi, delivery) in-house\n 2. Do some formal BD/Partnership deals where you allow a third-party to offer\n    their services through your app (e.g., WeChat offering ride-hailing via\n    Didi, Gojek offering medical product delivery via Halodoc)\n 3. Have a completely open product line where ANYONE can create their own app\n    within your app (WeChat: Mini programs)\n\nBy this definition, only WeChat is a full Super App. Grab and Gojek are still on\nstep 2, while many of the aspiring Western Super Apps are still on step 1.\n\nFor example, let’s take M1 Finance, a Chicago, USA-based company. They do offer\nseveral functions (checking account with a debit card, borrowing, investing),\nbut all of those functions are created, managed, and offered by M1.\n\nLet’s take a deeper look at Revolut. Going through their offerings, they include\nthings such as: checking accounts, money transfers, stock and cryptocurrency\npurchasing, insurance, and other financial related transactions. While some of\nthese might look like partnerships (Stock trading via DriveWealth, Insurance via\nSimplesurance), they are not in the same way that WeChat and Didi or Gojek and\nHalodoc are partners.\n\nRevolut uses DriveWealth\n[https://finovate.com/drivewealth-powers-commission-free-trading-for-revolut-cardholders/] \nto provide stock trading and uses Simplesurance [https://www.simplesurance.com/] \nfor their insurance products, but DriveWealth and Simplesurance are\nbehind-the-scenes service providers. Most people trading stocks with Revolut\nwill have no idea they are trading with DriveWealth as a third-party broker.\n\nThis is different than if Revolut users could click on “trading” in the Revolut\napp and it took them to a Robinhood or E-Trade UI that was built into Revolut.\n\n(Above is a photo of one of the Revolut UIs. Look familiar? 🤔🤔🤔🤔)\n\nConclusion\nThe Super App craze has swept eastern countries and western entrepreneurs want\nto build Super Apps of their own, but many of them are struggling to embrace the\nopen nature of building a Super App. For many reasons, I predict we will see\nmore apps trying to brand themselves as Super Apps because, not least of which,\nbranding yourself a Super App leads to a higher valuation than “vertically\nintegrated” does😉\n\nI’m excited to see attempts at building more Super Apps and I’m eager to try out\nAmerican contenders.\n\nIn my next issue, I will go through the crop of aspiring Super Apps (Facebook,\nUber, WhatsApp, Amazon, and more!) and break down the bull and bear case for\neach of them with ideas of my own.\n\nUntil then, thanks for reading!

As a percentage of its total population, that’s only about 11% though, which is not too high. The growth in banked % of the population is in part due to drastic measures from the government to decrease the country’s reliance on cash (via the controversial process of <a href=\"https://www.strategy-business.com/article/What-Happened-after-India-Eliminated-Cash?gko=1fea8\">demonetization</a>).</p><p>Notably, WhatsApp’s Head of India, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhbose/?originalSubdomain=in\">Abhijit Bose</a> was previously the CEO/Co-Founder of Ezetap, a mobile payments company in Bangalore.

I’m sure we will see Jio begin to sell items via stores built on top of WhatsApp.</p><p>From <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-indias-jio-won-facebooks-heart?utm_content=article-4598&amp;utm_campaign=article_email&amp;utm_source=sg&amp;utm_medium=email\">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>“For example, <strong>Jio and Facebook have announced a commercial agreement to allow consumers to shop for items at JioMarts within WhatsApp and pay for items with WhatsApp Pay</strong>. Both companies have said this agreement is independent of their investment relationship.”</blockquote><p>In <strong>Brazil</strong>, WhatsApp is also very active in running pilots to build out their payment offerings, likely with bigger ambitions of building a SuperApp for the country. WhatsApp <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/most-brazilian-consumers-interact-with-brands-through-whatsapp/\">is</a> “present in 99% of all smartphones in the country, according to the study into messaging in Brazil.” 🤯</p><p>In many ways, the story of WhatsApp is one of breaking the monopoly of exploitative telecom networks that were overcharging users for SMS. Per <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/the-rise-of-whatsapp-in-brazil-is-about-more-than-just-messaging\">HBR</a>:</p><blockquote>“The cost of SMS in [Brazil] was as much as <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/ActivateInc/activate-tech-and-media-outlook-2016/20-Sources_Gallup_Twilio_US_Census\">55 times more</a> than in North America and far too expensive for most residents. So when the messaging service WhatsApp <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/product/whatsapp#/entity\">entered the market, in 2009</a>, allowing users to send messages to anyone for free and regardless of their mobile carrier, people gravitated toward the platform. [In 2016], <a href=\"http://www.mobiletime.com.br/01/07/2015/mensageria-whatsapp-vs-messenger-vs-sms-qual-a-frequencia-de-uso-de-cada-um-no-brasil-/415303/news.aspx\">96% of Brazilians</a> with access to a smartphone use WhatsApp as their primary method of communication.”</blockquote><p>In Brazil, Facebook has enabled P2P transactions, using, as Mark <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10112015382953041&amp;set=a.612287952871&amp;type=3\">says</a>, “<strong>building on Facebook Pay</strong>, which provides a secure and consistent way to make payments across our apps”.</p><p>They’re also allowing individuals to make payments within WhatsApp chat with small businesses’ WhatsApp business accounts (photo on the right below)</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/09/image-3.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1455\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-3.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-3.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/09/image-3.png 1456w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>In WhatsApp dominated markets like India and Brazil, <strong>there are standalone businesses building their companies on-top of WhatsApp</strong>. Some examples include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.yalochat.com/\">Yalochat</a> which helps brands better connect with their users by building CRM, marketing, customer service, sales, and conversation tools on top of popular messaging apps (namely, WhatsApp). They’ve raised $23M from VCs like Sierra Ventures and B Capital Group and currently operate in LatAm, India, and are expanding into Southeast Asia (all WhatsApp-heavy markets)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.digi-prex.com/#work\">Digi-Prex</a> provides patients with one-stop online ordering using WhatsApp and also a reminder system for their monthly supply of medication. They recently went through the new Southeast Asia accelerator, <a href=\"https://iterative.vc/companies\">Iterative.vc</a></li><li><a href=\"https://vahan.ai/\">Vahan.ai</a> is a WhatsApp chatbot for the recruitment and training of blue-collar workers. They raised a seed round in 2019 from YC, Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, and others.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/22278\">ChatPay</a> is a Brazil-based company that enables people to monetize their WhatsApp and Telegram groups. They went through the YC Summer 2020 batch and raised a $2.1M seed round.</li></ul><p>I highlight that each of these companies raised money from well-known venture capitalists to make the point that these are not just products. These are teams trying to build venture-scale companies largely on top of WhatsApp. Like companies in China who build companies leveraging WeChat distribution, entrepreneurs are now leveraging the ubiquity of WhatsApp to build businesses for their local countries.</p><p>As WhatsApp continues to build more payment features into WhatsApp, these businesses have the potential to get stronger. Though, at the same time, as WhatsApp builds more business-focused features into WhatsApp these companies run some risk of being cannibalized by native features.</p><p>The strong bull case for WhatsApp is that it looks a lot like WeChat. It started as a messaging app that gained ubiquity across big markets and is adding payments and commerce functionality on top of that.</p><p>The pessimistic case for WhatsApp is that they’re a part of Facebook and they may not be able to chart their own course as WeChat did.</p><p>Who is the product leader that is really calling the shots at WhatsApp now that both of the founders are gone? Although WeChat was started within Tencent, Allen Zhang is very much the founder of WeChat and is still a driving force on product development today. His identity is burned into the product. As WhatsApp needs to make critical SuperApp choices down the road, who is that coming from? Who is deciding the tradeoff between crowding the feed with advertisements vs. continue to push off monetization?</p><p>Facebook’s culture is not entirely friendly to third-parties and is heavily reliant on advertising. WeChat’s openness and ability to allow anyone to build on top of it is one of the keys to its success. Facebook will need to be okay with winning alongside other companies that specialize in functions like ridesharing, etc.</p><p>For example, I’m excited to see if WhatsApp allows a Gojek integration inside of WhatsApp where users can hail a Gojek from WhatsApp.</p><p>This adds additional arguments in favor of Facebook’s investment in Gojek.</p><p>One of the aspects that makes Super Appdom harder in the West, that Tencent used to its advantage in China, is the ability to invest in and acquire meaningful ownership stakes in the companies that you will support as Tier 1 partners within your Super App.</p><p>As we covered in <a href=\"https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-part-2\">WeChat Part 2</a>:</p><blockquote>Can you guess what’s in common about all of the companies powering [the featured services within WeChat]? <strong>In most cases, Tencent is one of the company’s largest shareholders.</strong></blockquote><ul><li>Didi (Ride-Hailing) – Tencent owns ~20% of Didi.</li><li>JD.com (Specials) – Tencent <a href=\"https://fintel.io/so/us/jd/tencent-holdings\">owns</a> ~17% of JD, a ~$100bn+ public company</li><li>Moguejie (Women’s Fashion) – Tencent owned 17.2% at the time of Mogu’s 2018 IPO</li><li>Zhuan Zhuan (Used Goods) – Tencent <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/58com-announces-agreement-to-raise-us200-million-from-tencent-for-the-development-of-used-goods-trading-platform-zhuan-zhuan-300440606.html\">led</a> a $200M round in 2017</li><li>Ke.com – (Housing) – Tencent led a $800M round in 2019</li><li>Pinduoduo (Buy Together) – Tencent owned <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737806/000104746918005204/a2236308z424b4.htm#bG10401A_main_toc\">18.5%</a> at the time of the IPO. Tencent first invested in PDD in February of 2017 and added them onto the WeChat Pay page in February 2018</li></ul><p>For an aspiring Super App like Facebook or WhatsApp, these same opportunities were not available to them in the US.</p><p>Facebook likely did not have the opportunity to invest in a ride-hailing company like Uber or Lyft or an online marketplace like Wish. Also, given the maturity of the US market, some of the companies Facebook might have wanted to partner with (e.g., Netflix, Amazon, eBay) are older than Facebook, so the opportunity certainly was not available. But when you look at a country like Indonesia and think about Facebook’s Gojek investment in that light, it makes a lot of sense. It’s not too farfetched to imagine WhatsApp enabling users to call a Gojek through a WhatsApp mini-program-like feature. Keep an eye out for more investments from Facebook into markets like Indonesia.</p><p>Something I should have mentioned earlier… Here’s the <a href=\"https://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm\">list</a> of countries with the highest number of internet users.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"884\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png 600w\"></figure><p>Since Facebook/WhatsApp has no real entry point into China, India and Brazil make a lot of sense.</p><h2 id=\"messenger\"><strong><strong>Messenger</strong></strong></h2><p>As far back as 2015, Messenger attempted to add Super App functionality.

The article covers Bangladesh’s “<a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2020/bangladesh-economy-runs-on-facebook/?utm_source=Benedict%27s+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=784a6d6e7b-Benedict%27s+newsletter+issue+346&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_4999ca107f-784a6d6e7b-71167202\">F-commerce</a>” (“Facebook Commerce”) industry of individuals selling goods via Facebook Groups and Facebook Live streams.</p><p>An entire industry has been built up around these sellers. For example, “Paperfly is one of the bigger [logistics] players: it has already partnered with over 3,500 Facebook sellers and delivers to all 64 administrative districts of Bangladesh.”</p><p>In general, my worldview and view of successful companies tend to be more bottoms-up, than top-down. If I was on Facebook.com’s team, I would be laser-focused on markets like Bangladesh <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2020/bangladesh-economy-runs-on-facebook/?utm_source=Benedict%27s+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=784a6d6e7b-Benedict%27s+newsletter+issue+346&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_4999ca107f-784a6d6e7b-71167202\">where</a> “many consider “being on the internet” as simply having registered on Facebook.”</p><p><strong><strong>Instagram</strong></strong></p><p>For a Western-audience, I think understanding the case for Instagram as a SuperApp feels clearer.</p><p>Instagram built a popular, high-open rate application that is used by 1 billion+ people, with 130M users in the US. It’s also popular in India (100M), Brazil (91M), Indonesia (73M), and Russia (51M).</p><p>Besides its main function as a photo-sharing application, Instagram DM (it’s native message service) is also extremely popular, especially among younger generations that use it as a primary communication channel with friends.</p><p>The launch that really convinced me of Instagram’s full potential was seeing Instagram double down on in-app shopping.</p><p>Here’s an example of how Instagram could adopt some of the functionality that WeChat has and WhatsApp are building:</p><p>A friend of mine owns a boutique fashion store in New Jersey. Her store’s Instagram account has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/shopludovica/\">14.8k Instagram followers</a> and right now enables online ordering via Instagram DM.</p><p>By using Instagram’s new shopping tools, users would be able to purchase directly by clicking on a photo, adding it to their cart, and then checking out. An incredibly smooth flow. This also widens the market for brick and mortar businesses, which previously would have been limited to foot traffic, to global business from anyone who is interested in the type of clothing they sold. It changes some of the dynamics of my friend’s business where now just by posting beautiful photos, she can attract business from all over.</p><p>If Instagram added native QR code payments in their app, a user could go into my friend’s store and pay right from the Instagram app. That sounds a bit odd at first glance, but if the shoppers entire association with the store is through Instagram, it might not actually be that strange.</p><p>Now, I’m not a big Instagram user (I do have an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ryanrodenbaugh/\">account</a> though), nor do I like shopping, so I’ve never actually used Instagram Shopping.</p><p>For the purpose of this article, I decided to play around with it a bit. Along the way, I became more skeptical of the product. First, it’s called “Facebook Shops”. I’m more optimistic about the future of Instagram if Facebook lets it maintain the ethos that made it successful in the first place.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa07f974-abc6-40fa-9606-24d357a7882a_810x1044.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>When I went to a Tier 1 brand, the experience was excellent.

Say Tencent takes a 10% cut of Didi rides hailed through WeChat. Didi won ride-hailing in China, in part because of the Tencent investment/WeChat native integration (support from the “government” in my analogy) so paying the Super App tax is worth it. It’s a bit like trading profit margin for distribution. <strong>Thoughts?</strong></p><hr><p>I spent a lot of time focused on WhatsApp because I believe it’s the app most primed to become a Super App, but given Facebook’s resources, all of its properties have the ability to make the transition.</p><p>My critique throughout has been that I believe that some of Facebook’s cultural ethos is opposed to what has made other Super Apps successful (namely, eschewing advertising and deep integrations with third-parties).</p><p>Going forward I think this “Aspiring Super App” series will be a bit more sporadic. In my next issue, I plan (though plans could change) to go back to writing about companies, in the vein of my <a href=\"https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/gojek\">Gojek</a>, <a href=\"https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/grab\">Grab</a>, <a href=\"https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-a-not-so-brief-history\">WeChat</a> issues.

Appointing a seasoned payment exec\n(David Marcus) and making payments into a company-wide initiative (i.e., F2\nunderpins fb.com, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.) allows Facebook to have a powerful\nand unified payments experience across all of their applications.\n\n(It’s also fun to think about F2 becoming an AWS-like product where Facebook\nbuilds a powerful payment infrastructure for themselves that they can then sell\nto other companies. If Libra does become a thing, it actually sets Facebook up\nas a large global payments infrastructure provider.)\n\nThe Facebook Company has a few core properties that are primed to be Super Apps.\n\nIn order:\n\n 1.

As WeChat struggled to expand\nglobally, WhatsApp would have been the unlock for Tencent’s ambitions outside of\nChina.\n\nWith one big exception (privacy) WhatsApp and WeChat also had similar product\nphilosophies. Their founders cared much more about providing excellent\nexperiences for their users while not being concerned about monetization. They\nboth never wanted to ruin users’ experiences on the apps by overwhelming them\nwith advertisements.\n\nTencent would have been able to bring the SuperApp playbook to WhatsApp and\ncould have sped up their process of becoming a SuperApp in some markets like\nIndia (where WeChat made a big push but failed).\n\nAs of February 2020, WhatsApp has more than 2 billion users globally\n[https://blog.whatsapp.com/two-billion-users-connecting-the-world-privately] and\nsupports more than 50 million WhatsApp business app users.

As a percentage of its total population,\nthat’s only about 11% though, which is not too high.

These are teams\ntrying to build venture-scale companies largely on top of WhatsApp. Like\ncompanies in China who build companies leveraging WeChat distribution,\nentrepreneurs are now leveraging the ubiquity of WhatsApp to build businesses\nfor their local countries.\n\nAs WhatsApp continues to build more payment features into WhatsApp, these\nbusinesses have the potential to get stronger. Though, at the same time, as\nWhatsApp builds more business-focused features into WhatsApp these companies run\nsome risk of being cannibalized by native features.\n\nThe strong bull case for WhatsApp is that it looks a lot like WeChat. It started\nas a messaging app that gained ubiquity across big markets and is adding\npayments and commerce functionality on top of that.\n\nThe pessimistic case for WhatsApp is that they’re a part of Facebook and they\nmay not be able to chart their own course as WeChat did.\n\nWho is the product leader that is really calling the shots at WhatsApp now that\nboth of the founders are gone? Although WeChat was started within Tencent, Allen\nZhang is very much the founder of WeChat and is still a driving force on product\ndevelopment today. His identity is burned into the product. As WhatsApp needs to\nmake critical SuperApp choices down the road, who is that coming from? Who is\ndeciding the tradeoff between crowding the feed with advertisements vs. continue\nto push off monetization?\n\nFacebook’s culture is not entirely friendly to third-parties and is heavily\nreliant on advertising. WeChat’s openness and ability to allow anyone to build\non top of it is one of the keys to its success. Facebook will need to be okay\nwith winning alongside other companies that specialize in functions like\nridesharing, etc.\n\nFor example, I’m excited to see if WhatsApp allows a Gojek integration inside of\nWhatsApp where users can hail a Gojek from WhatsApp.\n\nThis adds additional arguments in favor of Facebook’s investment in Gojek.\n\nOne of the aspects that makes Super Appdom harder in the West, that Tencent used\nto its advantage in China, is the ability to invest in and acquire meaningful\nownership stakes in the companies that you will support as Tier 1 partners\nwithin your Super App.\n\nAs we covered in WeChat Part 2\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-part-2]:\n\n> Can you guess what’s in common about all of the companies powering [the featured\nservices within WeChat]?

Tencent first invested in PDD in February of 2017 and\n   added them onto the WeChat Pay page in February 2018\n\nFor an aspiring Super App like Facebook or WhatsApp, these same opportunities\nwere not available to them in the US.\n\nFacebook likely did not have the opportunity to invest in a ride-hailing company\nlike Uber or Lyft or an online marketplace like Wish. Also, given the maturity\nof the US market, some of the companies Facebook might have wanted to partner\nwith (e.g., Netflix, Amazon, eBay) are older than Facebook, so the opportunity\ncertainly was not available. But when you look at a country like Indonesia and\nthink about Facebook’s Gojek investment in that light, it makes a lot of sense.\nIt’s not too farfetched to imagine WhatsApp enabling users to call a Gojek\nthrough a WhatsApp mini-program-like feature. Keep an eye out for more\ninvestments from Facebook into markets like Indonesia.\n\nSomething I should have mentioned earlier… Here’s the list\n[https://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm] of countries with the highest\nnumber of internet users.\n\nSince Facebook/WhatsApp has no real entry point into China, India and Brazil\nmake a lot of sense.\n\nMessenger\nAs far back as 2015, Messenger attempted to add Super App functionality. At the\ntime, they partnered with Uber to make it possible for people to request an Uber\ndirectly from the Messenger app.\n\nI just spent 10 minutes digging through all the settings and extra features in\nMessenger and I don’t think the feature still exists.\n\nBut it’s an idea of what Messenger as a Super App could look like.\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, Messenger is a bigger platform than I recognized. In\nJanuary 2019, Facebook Messenger was still the top messaging app in 57 countries\n(e.g., US, Canada, Australia, Poland, Norway, some Northern African countries\nlike Egypt, Nigeria, Libya, etc.)\n\nEven though Facebook Messenger is still growing, it is losing its #1 position in\nmany markets, in all cases\n[https://www.similarweb.com/corp/blog/mobile-messaging-app-map-january-2019/] \nto… WhatsApp.\n\nIf The Facebook Company wanted to take a bet on building a Super App for the US,\nit seems like Messenger would be the horse to bet on, though as an overall\nglobal strategy, WhatsApp seems to be the better investment.\n\nI won’t write a ton more here because I think product-wise, Messenger would look\na lot like what I laid out for WhatsApp, just catering to different markets.\n\nFacebook.com\nThe media has not been shy about covering Mark Zuckerberg’s ambitions to turn\nFacebook.com into a WeChat-style Super App\n\nAnd looking at the current Facebook.com mobile experience, it appears to mimic\nsome of the Super App ideals – in terms of offering many experiences within one\napp.\n\nUnlike Super Apps such as WeChat, every one of those features in the Facebook\napp is owned and operated by Facebook.\n\n * Facebook’s dating product is built by Facebook, not a partnership with\n   Tinder.\n * Facebook “Videos on Watch” is built by Facebook, not a partnership with\n   YouTube or Twitch.\n\nAnd I think that’s the challenge for Facebook. While their in-house strategy has\nworked for them so far and turned them into the $700bn juggernaut that they are,\nit’s antithetical to building a Super App.\n\nWhile writing this article, one of my favorite articles and one that made me\nfeel most optimistic about Facebook’s potential as a SuperApp came from\nBangladesh. The article covers Bangladesh’s “F-commerce\n[https://restofworld.org/2020/bangladesh-economy-runs-on-facebook/?utm_source=Benedict%27s+Newsletter&utm_campaign=784a6d6e7b-Benedict%27s+newsletter+issue+346&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_4999ca107f-784a6d6e7b-71167202]\n” (“Facebook Commerce”) industry of individuals selling goods via Facebook\nGroups and Facebook Live streams.\n\nAn entire industry has been built up around these sellers. For example,\n“Paperfly is one of the bigger [logistics] players: it has already partnered\nwith over 3,500 Facebook sellers and delivers to all 64 administrative districts\nof Bangladesh.”\n\nIn general, my worldview and view of successful companies tend to be more\nbottoms-up, than top-down. If I was on Facebook.com’s team, I would be\nlaser-focused on markets like Bangladesh where\n[https://restofworld.org/2020/bangladesh-economy-runs-on-facebook/?utm_source=Benedict%27s+Newsletter&utm_campaign=784a6d6e7b-Benedict%27s+newsletter+issue+346&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_4999ca107f-784a6d6e7b-71167202] \n“many consider “being on the internet” as simply having registered on Facebook.”\n\nInstagram\n\nFor a Western-audience, I think understanding the case for Instagram as a\nSuperApp feels clearer.\n\nInstagram built a popular, high-open rate application that is used by 1 billion+\npeople, with 130M users in the US. It’s also popular in India (100M), Brazil\n(91M), Indonesia (73M), and Russia (51M).\n\nBesides its main function as a photo-sharing application, Instagram DM (it’s\nnative message service) is also extremely popular, especially among younger\ngenerations that use it as a primary communication channel with friends.\n\nThe launch that really convinced me of Instagram’s full potential was seeing\nInstagram double down on in-app shopping.\n\nHere’s an example of how Instagram could adopt some of the functionality that\nWeChat has and WhatsApp are building:\n\nA friend of mine owns a boutique fashion store in New Jersey. Her store’s\nInstagram account has 14.8k Instagram followers\n[https://www.instagram.com/shopludovica/] and right now enables online ordering\nvia Instagram DM.\n\nBy using Instagram’s new shopping tools, users would be able to purchase\ndirectly by clicking on a photo, adding it to their cart, and then checking out.\nAn incredibly smooth flow. This also widens the market for brick and mortar\nbusinesses, which previously would have been limited to foot traffic, to global\nbusiness from anyone who is interested in the type of clothing they sold. It\nchanges some of the dynamics of my friend’s business where now just by posting\nbeautiful photos, she can attract business from all over.\n\nIf Instagram added native QR code payments in their app, a user could go into my\nfriend’s store and pay right from the Instagram app. That sounds a bit odd at\nfirst glance, but if the shoppers entire association with the store is through\nInstagram, it might not actually be that strange.\n\nNow, I’m not a big Instagram user (I do have an account\n[https://www.instagram.com/ryanrodenbaugh/] though), nor do I like shopping, so\nI’ve never actually used Instagram Shopping.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, I decided to play around with it a bit. Along\nthe way, I became more skeptical of the product. First, it’s called “Facebook\nShops”. I’m more optimistic about the future of Instagram if Facebook lets it\nmaintain the ethos that made it successful in the first place.\n\nWhen I went to a Tier 1 brand, the experience was excellent. Looking at this\nrecent Zara photo, they tag all the things on the woman’s necklace and you can\neasily add to your cart and checkout.\n\nWhen I went to a brand that I actually shop with, Bearbottom Clothing\n[https://bearbottomclothing.com/], the experience was suboptimal.\n\nI was not able to add their clothing items directly to the Instagram shopping\ncart. I was redirected to the Bearbottom website to do my payment and checkout\nthere. It’s possible that this is Bearbottom’s fault and they have not set up\nthe right account yet.\n\nThe worst part though, from the brand perspective is that underneath the pair of\nshorts I clicked on was “similar items” from other retailers. If I’m a brand\ntrying to sell on Instagram, the last thing I want to see if knock-off or\ncompeting products advertised beneath my own.\n\nAnd this is one of the reasons to be bearish on Facebook-owned products chances\nat becoming Super Apps. Facebook has an engrained culture and product ethos\naround advertising that could be antithetical to other apps living on top of\ntheir platforms.\n\nBut for Instagram specifically, given how beautiful the feed can be, it seems\nlike a prime app to e.g., connect to Uber Eats and easily allow you to order\nsomething from a photo.\n\nClosing Thoughts\nOne other framing I thought of to describe Super Apps is that they’re basically\nlike a government collecting sales tax. Say Tencent takes a 10% cut of Didi\nrides hailed through WeChat. Didi won ride-hailing in China, in part because of\nthe Tencent investment/WeChat native integration (support from the “government”\nin my analogy) so paying the Super App tax is worth it. It’s a bit like trading\nprofit margin for distribution. Thoughts?\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI spent a lot of time focused on WhatsApp because I believe it’s the app most\nprimed to become a Super App, but given Facebook’s resources, all of its\nproperties have the ability to make the transition.\n\nMy critique throughout has been that I believe that some of Facebook’s cultural\nethos is opposed to what has made other Super Apps successful (namely, eschewing\nadvertising and deep integrations with third-parties).\n\nGoing forward I think this “Aspiring Super App” series will be a bit more\nsporadic.

Jack Ma had the goal of opening up the Chinese market to the rest of the world.</li><li>September 1999: Alibaba sold a 50% stake to Goldman Sachs and other investors. (Jack Ma would later call the worst deal he ever made.)</li><li>January 2000: Softbank invests $20M into Alibaba for 30% of the company. As an avid follower of modern Softbank/Masa Son stories, the investment into Alibaba 20-years ago is no different. Masa wanted to invest more in Alibaba, but Jack did not let him. One excerpt from the book:</li></ul><blockquote>At their first meeting, after Jack had finished describing Alibaba, by now some 100,000 [users] strong, Son immediately turned the conversation to how much SoftBank could invest</blockquote><blockquote>“I listened to Mr. Ma’s speech for five minutes and decided on the spot that I was ready to invest in Alibaba,” Son recalled. <strong>Son interrupted Jack’s presentation to tell him he should take SoftBank’s money because he “should spend money more quickly.”</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Around the time of Alibaba’s 2014 IPO, Son was asked what it was that prompted him to bet on Jack back in 2000: “It was the look in his eye, it was an ‘animal smell.’ . . . It was the same when we invested in Yahoo . . . when they were still only five to six people. <strong>I invested based on my sense of smell.”</strong></blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F693796c5-f461-4701-acd0-907405b0cb28_480x360.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Why Masayoshi Son Invested $20 Million in a Young Jack Ma - YouTube\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>(Masa’s sense of smell yielded Softbank about $200,000,000,000 on the Alibaba investment)</p><ul><li>Late 2002: SoftBank invested $50 million into a joint venture with Alibaba to create an eBay competitor in China (“Taobao”).

At the time this was 1/3 of Yahoo’s balance sheet.</li><li>2006: eBay closed down EachNet. This is a classic case study in how to not manage a business in China.

It’s hard to find the exact number, but of that 31.7% owned by management and employees, Jack Ma seems to have owned about 8% total of Alibaba.</p><p>After the launch of the escrow service in 2003, the team working on Alipay spent the next several years developing integrations with all the major banks in China. Between 2003 and 2010, Alipay was still predominately just an escrow service, though the importance of this feature should not be undersold. Taobao and Alipay had an extremely synergistic relationship, similar to that of eBay and PayPal. Taobao had so much success in China against eBay because of the trust that the Alipay escrow enabled. As a result, Alipay saw its growth rise in tandem with Taobao’s.</p><p>In 2010, the Chinese central bank issued <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/alibaba-ma/update-1-at-chinas-alibaba-chairman-mas-dealings-raise-red-flags-idUSL3N0NU45I20140508\">regulations</a> pertaining to third-party payment companies like Alipay. In short, companies like Alipay would need to obtain a license to operate within China and the requirements for foreign-owned companies would be more stringent. Since Alibaba was majority-owned by Yahoo! (US-company) and Softbank (Japanese-company), this posed an issue for Alipay.</p><p>In May 2011, it was made public that Alipay, which was estimated to be worth ~$1bn at the time, had been transferred out of Alibaba and was owned by a domestic Chinese company that Jack Ma controlled an 80% interest in. Majority shareholders like Softbank and Yahoo were not informed of the transfer and did not have direct ownership in the new entity. Alibaba also did not maintain an ownership stake in the new Alipay entity.</p><p>Per a footnote in Yahoo’s quarterly earnings at the time,</p><blockquote>To expedite obtaining an essential regulatory license, the ownership of Alibaba Group’s online payment business, Alipay, was restructured so that a hundred percent of its outstanding shares are held by a Chinese domestic company which is majority owned by Alibaba Group’s chief executive officer. Alibaba Group’s management and its principal shareholders, Yahoo and Softbank Corporation, are engaged in ongoing discussions regarding the terms of the restructuring and the appropriate commercial arrangements related to the online payment business.</blockquote><p>This would further sour the already deteriorating relationship between Alibaba and Yahoo, while also putting stress on Alibaba’s relation with Softbank.</p><p>The TL/DR of the rest of this story is:</p><ul><li>Between 2014 and 2019, Alipay (aka Ant Financial aka Ant Group) agreed to pay Alibaba 37.5% of its pre-tax profit along with some royalties for software services.</li><li>In 2019, with an Ant Group IPO becoming a reality, Alibaba and Ant Group <a href=\"https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-agrees-33-stake-ant-financial/\">terminated</a> that profit-sharing agreement and Alibaba took a 33% equity stake in newly-issued shares of Ant “ in exchange for certain intellectual property rights owned by Alibaba exclusively related to Ant Financial.” Alibaba did not pay cash to acquire the new Ant shares.</li></ul><p>While, to a degree, the split of the two companies makes sense, they are still integral to each other. Alibaba’s CFO was quoted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/267c395c-de94-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc\">saying</a>, “some 20% of new users to e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall came from Ant”.</p><p>And while Alibaba is Ant’s largest customer, the % of revenues have been coming down over time. In 2019, Alibaba accounted for 8% of Ant Groups’ revenues and by the first half of 2020, that percent was down to 6%.</p><p>This controversy over foreign ownership makes me think of the current <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh/status/1307911007063269377?s=20\">TikTok/US Government</a> kerfuffle. But instead of China not wanting foreign ownership of its payment companies (AliPay), it’s the US that does not want Chinese ownership of TikTok.</p><p><strong><strong><strong>Alipay —&gt; Ant Financial —&gt; Ant Group</strong></strong></strong></p><p>Ant Group is a tech-enabled financial services company.

These were services that were mostly offered directly by the Ant team.</p><p>The rebrand from Ant Financial —&gt; Ant Group seems to have been motivated by the fact that the company had become a marketplace of financial products offered by other institutions, rather than just products built by Ant. In some ways, this makes their offerings look more like a technology company monetizing through lead gen for financial institutions, along with some of their own products alongside. This decision seems to have been <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-ant-financial-regulation-exclus/exclusive-ant-financial-shifts-focus-from-finance-to-tech-services-sources-idUSKCN1J10WV\">motivated</a> by a regulatory clampdown,</p><blockquote>Ant Financial was singled out by the People’s Bank of China as the only online finance firm for a trial program to test stricter regulations on financial holding conglomerates, two of the sources said. “As a non-bank, non-state-owned institution in China, it’s not allowed to independently grow too big to manage,” said one of the sources.</blockquote><p>Earlier on, during the transition from Alipay to Ant Financial, the company ran a playbook similar to what we’ve seen common with other FinTech companies, targeting small businesses and users who were underserved by the traditional banking system and using technology to offer them a wide range of services. As a result, their earliest offerings included digital payments and virtual bank accounts.</p><p>Over time, they added other functionality including the ability to pay not just from a pre-funded e-wallet checking account, but also the ability to pay directly from a line of credit or interest-earning money market fund (more on this later).</p><p>Beyond that, it is the “digital daily life services” ecosystem built around Alipay payments that gives Alipay its Super App characteristics.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F809febcd-1410-45d5-a1b0-6bc8a922d60e_700x983.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Alipay, Ant Group's flagship superapp\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Like other Super Apps we’ve studied in this newsletter, Alipay offers popular applications (ridesharing, home cleaning, pay bills) all within the Alipay home screen.

This makes them the largest investment platform in China.</p><p>In 2013, when the Ant team recognized that the Chinese population was very conservative savers (mostly bank deposits and property) they launched Yu’ebao, a money market and investment platform.</p><p>Months after launching Yu’ebao, Ant Group bought a 51% stake in Tianhong Asset Management to integrate the platform with one of its underlying financial partners (the fund that would actually be managing the money and generating a return for users).</p><p>Very quickly, Tianhong became the largest mutual fund in China and within a few years, was the largest money market fund <strong>globally</strong>.</p><p>As covered briefly in my <a href=\"https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-part-2\">WeChat issue</a>:</p><blockquote>“Alipay launched the Tianhong Yu’e Bao Money Market Fund (which basically amounted to a high-yield checking account) for users in 2013 and by 2017, <strong>it was the largest money market fund in the world, surpassing offerings from JP Morgan, Fidelity, and Vanguard. </strong>By March 2019, the Tianhong Yu’e Bao fund (which translates to “leftover treasure”) had about 588 million clients, 1/3 of the Chinese population.”</blockquote><p>That’s launching a product at scale.</p><p>Two of the key features of Yu’ebao are that (1) it has instant redemptions, meaning that users can either spend their invested funds instantly or redeem their funds in cash the same day (2) you can invest with as little as RMB 1 ($0.15). In that sense, the low threshold for participation offered broad financial inclusion for anyone in China with a smartphone to gain access to an account yielding 3-6% annually.</p><p>In line with Ant’s broader philosophy of becoming more of a tech firm and less of a financial services firm, Ant Group launched a second investment product, Dalicai (translates to “broad investment management products”). This is a marketplace of different investment products (besides just Tianhong) from different providers and with different risk profiles.</p><p>From the S1,</p><blockquote>In investments, we operate the largest investment platform by AUM in China for consumers to shop for investment products, providing unparalleled reach to partner asset managers.

Insurance penetration in China is about 1/3 of that of the US.</p><p>However, even though the dollar amount might be low, Ant Group says that between June 2019 and June 2020, over 570 million Alipay users “purchased insurance or were insured on our platform, or participated in Xianghubao mutual aid program”</p><p>A big part of Ant Group’s growth in its insurance vertical comes from Xianghubao, a standalone insurance product that also acts as a sort of top-of-funnel for the group’s other insurance products. The product is well covered in this <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3039554/ant-financials-mutual-aid-platform-xiang-hu-bao-attracts-100\">SCMP article</a> from my friend, Georgina Lee.</p><p>In short, Xianghubao is, what Ant Group calls, a “mutual aid” or “collective claim sharing” product. Anyone under 59 years old can sign up to protect against 100 types of critical illness. It requires no upfront payments or premiums. However, whenever a claim is submitted by someone, all the other users of Xianghubao will pay their approved claims. Per S1:</p><blockquote>“If the claim is approved, the participant will receive a one-time payout, the cost of which is shared equally by all other participants. In 2019, the average annual contribution made by each Xianghubao participant to cover claims was RMB29 ($4).”</blockquote><p>Per <a href=\"https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2019/04/11/523411.htm\">insurance journal</a></p><blockquote><em>Given the growing user base, every member should pay no more than 0.1 ($0.015) yuan for every critically ill person, according to Ant. It covers a list of no more than 100 ailments. If a dispute over claims arises, a jury consisting of hundreds of thousands of pre-approved users will vote on whether to pay out compensation.</em></blockquote><p>As of June 30, 2020, the product had more than 100 million active members.</p><p>And per the S1, it seems like this inexpensive product has made more Chinese people aware of insurance product offerings and has led them to purchase other more typical insurance products (i.e., those underwritten by an insurance partner).</p><p>Ant’s other insurance products look similar to the scenario-based insurance products I’ve written about in <a href=\"https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/gojek\">Gojek</a> and <a href=\"https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/grab\">Grab</a> issues. Ant describes this as</p><blockquote>“We have designed our scenario-based insurance products based on the unique characteristics of e-commerce transactions, i.e. low-ticket size with high frequency.”</blockquote><p>These low barriers to entry products are in line with what Ant did with their investment products and points to what I view as a broader product philosophy for Ant.</p><p>Build a product in-house (for investment: Yu’ebao w/ Tianhong, for insurance: Xianghubao), get the market comfortable with an inexpensive, low-friction product, and then open up to a marketplace of more sophisticated products, partnering with traditional financial institutions.</p><p>Pretty brilliant and repeatable playbook for other financial verticals.

It is a technology company that offers\ndozens of financial services products and Super App functionalities throughout\nChina. They also operate globally via joint ventures and investments into other\npayments companies.\n\nAs I write this post, Ant Group is approaching a dual IPO listing in Hong Kong\nand Shanghai that would see the company raise $35 billion and value it north of\n$250 billion.\n\nAs Bloomberg\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-23/ant-plans-17-5-billion-hong-kong-ipo-no-cornerstone-investors?sref=H3VOPQIG] \nnotes,\n\n> If markets are favorable, Ant’s IPO may top Saudi Aramco\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ARAMCO:AB]’s record $29 billion sale.\n> Ant could exceed Bank of America Corp. [https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BAC:US]\n’s market capitalization, and be more than twice the size of Citigroup Inc.\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/C:US]\n> Among U.S. banks, only JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US] is bigger at almost $290 billion.\nAnt Group’s founder and majority shareholder is Alibaba co-founder, Jack Ma, the\nChinese founder most known to a Western audience.\n\nThe story of Alibaba is a crazy one, well-covered in a book I enjoyed a few\nyears ago called, Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built\n[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25817524-alibaba].\n\nThere are several details covered in the book, specific to Alibaba’s funding\nhistory that give some additional context to the Ant Group / Ant Financial\nstory.\n\nFrom Alibaba to Ant Group\nA brief backstory on Alibaba and its funding history that sets up the Ant Group\nstory:\n\n * April 1999: Alibaba is founded in Hangzhou, China as a B2B commerce\n   marketplace. Jack Ma had the goal of opening up the Chinese market to the\n   rest of the world.\n * September 1999: Alibaba sold a 50% stake to Goldman Sachs and other\n   investors. (Jack Ma would later call the worst deal he ever made.)\n * January 2000: Softbank invests $20M into Alibaba for 30% of the company. As\n   an avid follower of modern Softbank/Masa Son stories, the investment into\n   Alibaba 20-years ago is no different. Masa wanted to invest more in Alibaba,\n   but Jack did not let him. One excerpt from the book:\n\n> At their first meeting, after Jack had finished describing Alibaba, by now some\n100,000 [users] strong, Son immediately turned the conversation to how much\nSoftBank could invest\n> “I listened to Mr. Ma’s speech for five minutes and decided on the spot that I\nwas ready to invest in Alibaba,” Son recalled. Son interrupted Jack’s\npresentation to tell him he should take SoftBank’s money because he “should\nspend money more quickly.”\n> Around the time of Alibaba’s 2014 IPO, Son was asked what it was that prompted\nhim to bet on Jack back in 2000: “It was the look in his eye, it was an ‘animal\nsmell.’ . . . It was the same when we invested in Yahoo . . . when they were\nstill only five to six people. I invested based on my sense of smell.”\n(Masa’s sense of smell yielded Softbank about $200,000,000,000 on the Alibaba\ninvestment)\n\n * Late 2002: SoftBank invested $50 million into a joint venture with Alibaba to\n   create an eBay competitor in China (“Taobao”). Softbank invested an\n   additional $30 million in convertible notes that they could later convert\n   into ordinary shares.\n * May 2003: Alibaba launches the JV, called “Taobao” (“hunting for treasure” in\n   English).\n * July 2003: eBay acquires EachNet (the actual “eBay of China” at the time) for\n   a total of $180M\n * October 2003: Alibaba launched Alipay, which served as an escrow service to\n   minimize the trust needed between buyers and sellers on the Taobao\n   marketplace.\n * February 2004: Softbank led a new $82M investment into Alibaba and Goldman\n   sold its 33% stake\n * 2005: eBay tried to buy Alibaba. But the bid-ask was $150M / $900M. After the\n   failed acquisition attempt, eBay committed $100M to grow its China\n   operations.\n * July 2005: Yahoo invests $1bn into Alibaba for a 40% stake. At the time this\n   was 1/3 of Yahoo’s balance sheet.\n * 2006: eBay closed down EachNet. This is a classic case study in how to not\n   manage a business in China. For example, eBay, at one point, decided to move\n   its servers from China to the US. The great firewall did not approve…\n\nMeg Whitman, reflecting on this misstep after she left eBay highlights what is\nbecoming a common theme in this newsletter,\n\n> “You’ve got to have a set of products uniquely designed for this market by\nChinese. It is not a market where you can take a product or a system that works\nin Europe or the United States and export to China.”\nLocalism, FTW!\n\nGiven all of Alibaba’s fundraising, particularly it’s early stock sale to\nGoldman Sachs, the share structure of Alibaba, at the time of its IPO was\n[https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2007/1023/ltn20071023003.htm]\n:\n\nJack Ma owned a much smaller % of his company than many of his peers in the\nChinese tech industry. It’s hard to find the exact number, but of that 31.7%\nowned by management and employees, Jack Ma seems to have owned about 8% total of\nAlibaba.\n\nAfter the launch of the escrow service in 2003, the team working on Alipay spent\nthe next several years developing integrations with all the major banks in\nChina. Between 2003 and 2010, Alipay was still predominately just an escrow\nservice, though the importance of this feature should not be undersold. Taobao\nand Alipay had an extremely synergistic relationship, similar to that of eBay\nand PayPal. Taobao had so much success in China against eBay because of the\ntrust that the Alipay escrow enabled. As a result, Alipay saw its growth rise in\ntandem with Taobao’s.\n\nIn 2010, the Chinese central bank issued regulations\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/alibaba-ma/update-1-at-chinas-alibaba-chairman-mas-dealings-raise-red-flags-idUSL3N0NU45I20140508] \npertaining to third-party payment companies like Alipay. In short, companies\nlike Alipay would need to obtain a license to operate within China and the\nrequirements for foreign-owned companies would be more stringent. Since Alibaba\nwas majority-owned by Yahoo! (US-company) and Softbank (Japanese-company), this\nposed an issue for Alipay.\n\nIn May 2011, it was made public that Alipay, which was estimated to be worth\n~$1bn at the time, had been transferred out of Alibaba and was owned by a\ndomestic Chinese company that Jack Ma controlled an 80% interest in. Majority\nshareholders like Softbank and Yahoo were not informed of the transfer and did\nnot have direct ownership in the new entity. Alibaba also did not maintain an\nownership stake in the new Alipay entity.\n\nPer a footnote in Yahoo’s quarterly earnings at the time,\n\n> To expedite obtaining an essential regulatory license, the ownership of Alibaba\nGroup’s online payment business, Alipay, was restructured so that a hundred\npercent of its outstanding shares are held by a Chinese domestic company which\nis majority owned by Alibaba Group’s chief executive officer. Alibaba Group’s\nmanagement and its principal shareholders, Yahoo and Softbank Corporation, are\nengaged in ongoing discussions regarding the terms of the restructuring and the\nappropriate commercial arrangements related to the online payment business.\nThis would further sour the already deteriorating relationship between Alibaba\nand Yahoo, while also putting stress on Alibaba’s relation with Softbank.\n\nThe TL/DR of the rest of this story is:\n\n * Between 2014 and 2019, Alipay (aka Ant Financial aka Ant Group) agreed to pay\n   Alibaba 37.5% of its pre-tax profit along with some royalties for software\n   services.\n * In 2019, with an Ant Group IPO becoming a reality, Alibaba and Ant Group \n   terminated [https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-agrees-33-stake-ant-financial/] \n   that profit-sharing agreement and Alibaba took a 33% equity stake in\n   newly-issued shares of Ant “ in exchange for certain intellectual property\n   rights owned by Alibaba exclusively related to Ant Financial.” Alibaba did\n   not pay cash to acquire the new Ant shares.\n\nWhile, to a degree, the split of the two companies makes sense, they are still\nintegral to each other. Alibaba’s CFO was quoted saying\n[https://www.ft.com/content/267c395c-de94-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc], “some 20% of\nnew users to e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall came from Ant”.\n\nAnd while Alibaba is Ant’s largest customer, the % of revenues have been coming\ndown over time. In 2019, Alibaba accounted for 8% of Ant Groups’ revenues and by\nthe first half of 2020, that percent was down to 6%.\n\nThis controversy over foreign ownership makes me think of the current TikTok/US\nGovernment [https://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh/status/1307911007063269377?s=20] \nkerfuffle. But instead of China not wanting foreign ownership of its payment\ncompanies (AliPay), it’s the US that does not want Chinese ownership of TikTok.\n\nAlipay —> Ant Financial —> Ant Group\n\nAnt Group is a tech-enabled financial services company. It offers a wide range\nof financial services along with Super App functionality built around China’s\ntop payments platform.\n\nAnt Group describes its business as the “Alipay Platform” which encompasses\ndigital payments, digital finance, and digital daily life services. Today, the\nAlipay app has 1bn+ users and 80M+ merchants connected to the platform.\n\nThe Ant Group S1 breaks its business out relatively straightforward. Payments at\nthe center of everything, surrounded by core “digital finance” offerings\nincluding investment tech, credit tech, and insurance tech. Surrounding that\ninner circle includes all the other apps (mobility, municipal, local, and other)\nthat give Alipay its Super App functionality.\n\nAs the company went from being a single product company, Alipay (2003) —> Ant\nFinancial (2014) —> Ant Group (2020), its products and types of offerings grew\nas well.\n\nBy the time of the 2014 rebrand from just Alipay —> Ant Financial, the company’s\ncore properties included\n[https://www.ft.com/content/366490b4-0b7d-11e6-9cd4-2be898308be3?ref=hackernoon.com] \nAlipay, Yu’ebao and Tianhong (investment platform), MyBank (an online-only\nlender which Ant owned 30% of), and Sesame Credit (a credit rating system).\nThese were services that were mostly offered directly by the Ant team.\n\nThe rebrand from Ant Financial —> Ant Group seems to have been motivated by the\nfact that the company had become a marketplace of financial products offered by\nother institutions, rather than just products built by Ant. In some ways, this\nmakes their offerings look more like a technology company monetizing through\nlead gen for financial institutions, along with some of their own products\nalongside. This decision seems to have been motivated\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-ant-financial-regulation-exclus/exclusive-ant-financial-shifts-focus-from-finance-to-tech-services-sources-idUSKCN1J10WV] \nby a regulatory clampdown,\n\n> Ant Financial was singled out by the People’s Bank of China as the only online\nfinance firm for a trial program to test stricter regulations on financial\nholding conglomerates, two of the sources said. “As a non-bank, non-state-owned\ninstitution in China, it’s not allowed to independently grow too big to manage,”\nsaid one of the sources.\nEarlier on, during the transition from Alipay to Ant Financial, the company ran\na playbook similar to what we’ve seen common with other FinTech companies,\ntargeting small businesses and users who were underserved by the traditional\nbanking system and using technology to offer them a wide range of services. As a\nresult, their earliest offerings included digital payments and virtual bank\naccounts.\n\nOver time, they added other functionality including the ability to pay not just\nfrom a pre-funded e-wallet checking account, but also the ability to pay\ndirectly from a line of credit or interest-earning money market fund (more on\nthis later).\n\nBeyond that, it is the “digital daily life services” ecosystem built around\nAlipay payments that gives Alipay its Super App characteristics.\n\nLike other Super Apps we’ve studied in this newsletter, Alipay offers popular\napplications (ridesharing, home cleaning, pay bills) all within the Alipay home\nscreen. I spoke to some friends in China to get an understanding of where one\nmight use Alipay vs WeChat Pay. WeChat pay seems to be used in low transfer\nvalue situations (e.g., send a friend some money) and that its more common to\nuse Super App functionality of WeChat, whereas Alipay is for bigger purchases\nand other financial focused transactions (wealth management paying bills, etc.).\n\nOverall, Alipay’s Super App functionality seems to be useful.\n\nThey state in their S1 that between June 2019 and 2020 that over 60% of users\ncame to the Alipay app for daily life services. I’d personally love to see a\nbreakdown of e.g., Didi rides hailed on Alipay vs WeChat pay.\n\nOne of the things I find most powerful about Super Apps we’ve studied is their\nability to empower small business owners. Alipay is no exception. They’ve helped\nto digitize many merchants, giving them new tools to market, create loyalty\nprograms, organize promotions, and interact with users. All built around the\nexperience of payments.\n\nAnt Group Today\nToday, Ant Group generates 99% of its revenue through four business lines that\ncorresponded to RMB 52 billion ($7.6 billion) in revenue for 2019.\n\n 1. Payments (43% of revenues in 2019)\n 2. Credit Products (34.7% of revenue and the fastest-growing segment)\n 3. Investment/Asset management (14.1% of revenue)\n 4. Insurance (7.4% of revenue)\n\nPayments\nQR code payments in China are synonymous with Alipay (and WeChat Pay). Ant Group\nmaintains a duopoly in this market alongside Tencent’s WeChat. In the twelve\nmonths preceding June 30, 2020, the total transactions across the Alipay\nPlatform totaled RMB118 Trillion ($17 Trillion, more than China’s 2019 GDP)\n\nIn 2010, Alipay launched\n[https://www.mobileworldlive.com/money/news-money/alipay-launches-mobile-wallet] \nan updated mobile app that would allow users to make in-person (“online to\noffline” as they call it) payments using QR codes. This was the catalyst that\nwould transform China into the QR-code payment-enabled country that we read so\nmuch about today.\n\nAnt Group also has the coveted position of being the promoted payment option on\nAlibaba’s massive online properties including Taobao, Tmall, and 1688.com.\n\nRevenue from payments is standard, “charging merchants and transaction platforms\ntransaction fees based on a percentage of transaction volume. We also charge\nusers for personal transactions such as transfer to bank accounts and credit\ncard repayments”. One thing to note is that as a result of charges being applied\nfor transferring back to bank accounts, users opt to just leave balances in\nAlipay.\n\nWithin China, the tailwinds for digital payments are strong. Per iResearch,\n\n> “China’s digital payments transaction volume was RMB201 trillion in 2019 […] \nChina’s mobile payments users reached 87.2% of the total mobile Internet\npopulation in China in 2019”\nOutside of China, the payments business is tougher for Ant Group. They “only”\ndid $91 billion in transaction volume in the 12-months leading up to 2020.\n\nLooking at the rest of Ant’s products, payments were just the opening move.\nPayments became the way to attract consumers with no marketing spend and to\nbuild a giant ecosystem around the app, enabling the rest of the products to\ngrow.\n\nCredit Tech\nWorking with over 100 bank and trust companies, Alipay’s credit offering has a\ncredit balance of RMB1.7 trillion ($255 billion) across its SMB and consumer\ncustomers. This makes them the largest credit provider in China for consumers\nand SMBs. 98% of that credit is underwritten by their financial partners.\n\nAnt Group generates service fees from their partner financial institutions as a\npercentage of the interest income generated on credit balances enabled through\nthe Alipay platform.\n\nFrom the S1,\n\n> “In credit, we leverage our intelligent decisioning systems to originate loans\nwhich are then primarily underwritten by financial institutions. For these\nfinancial institutions, our technology and customer insights allow them to\ncost-effectively grow their loan book, while our dynamic risk management\nsolutions maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of onboarding, underwriting\nand monitoring. Our approach is not to use our balance sheet or provide\nguarantees.”\nTheir credit offering is composed of two core products:\n\n * Huabei 花唄 – An unsecured revolving credit product. This is a bit like a\n   starter-credit product. Similar to a credit card, consumers have a 40-day\n   window to pay off their balances without accruing interest. The limits for\n   how much debt you can accrue are relatively low.\n * Jiebie 借唄 – This is for users with better credit scores or those that\n   demonstrated a good track record on Huabei. Low rates, higher balances, etc.\n\nThese products have extremely low defaults. Since Alipay is connected to all\nyour financial accounts, it will automatically collect repayments first by\nchecking your Alipay e-wallet balance, then your debit card linked to Alipay,\nthen your Yu’ebao (wealth management) account.\n\nThe Ant Group teams works closely with their banking partners to “utilize more\nadvanced joint credit risk models”\n\nAn overview of how that process works:\n\nInvestment Tech (Asset Management)\nWorking with 170+ asset managers, Alipay has an investment AUM from customers of\nRMB4.1 trillion ($603 billion). This makes them the largest investment platform\nin China.\n\nIn 2013, when the Ant team recognized that the Chinese population was very\nconservative savers (mostly bank deposits and property) they launched Yu’ebao, a\nmoney market and investment platform.\n\nMonths after launching Yu’ebao, Ant Group bought a 51% stake in Tianhong Asset\nManagement to integrate the platform with one of its underlying financial\npartners (the fund that would actually be managing the money and generating a\nreturn for users).\n\nVery quickly, Tianhong became the largest mutual fund in China and within a few\nyears, was the largest money market fund globally.\n\nAs covered briefly in my WeChat issue\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-part-2]:\n\n> “Alipay launched the Tianhong Yu’e Bao Money Market Fund (which basically\namounted to a high-yield checking account) for users in 2013 and by 2017, it was\nthe largest money market fund in the world, surpassing offerings from JP Morgan,\nFidelity, and Vanguard. By March 2019, the Tianhong Yu’e Bao fund (which\ntranslates to “leftover treasure”) had about 588 million clients, 1/3 of the\nChinese population.”\nThat’s launching a product at scale.\n\nTwo of the key features of Yu’ebao are that (1) it has instant redemptions,\nmeaning that users can either spend their invested funds instantly or redeem\ntheir funds in cash the same day (2) you can invest with as little as RMB 1\n($0.15). In that sense, the low threshold for participation offered broad\nfinancial inclusion for anyone in China with a smartphone to gain access to an\naccount yielding 3-6% annually.\n\nIn line with Ant’s broader philosophy of becoming more of a tech firm and less\nof a financial services firm, Ant Group launched a second investment product,\nDalicai (translates to “broad investment management products”). This is a\nmarketplace of different investment products (besides just Tianhong) from\ndifferent providers and with different risk profiles.\n\nFrom the S1,\n\n> In investments, we operate the largest investment platform by AUM in China for\nconsumers to shop for investment products, providing unparalleled reach to\npartner asset managers. This platform substantially lowers the cost of\ninvestment product distribution and ensures a superior user experience.\nInvestment managers also value our AI capabilities on the platform, providing\nintelligent matching of investment products against investor’s risk tolerance,\nfor it is critical to ensure product suitability and sustainable industry\ngrowth.\nInsurance Tech\nAt this point, nothing to be surprised about, but working with ~90 insurance\ninstitutions, Alipay is the largest insurance platform in China as well with\nabout RMB 52 billion ($7 billion) in premiums and contributions.\n\nIt seems that the reason this vertical is so small (relative to Ant Group’s\nother revenue centers) is due to the fact that China as a country is very\nunderinsured. Insurance penetration in China is about 1/3 of that of the US.\n\nHowever, even though the dollar amount might be low, Ant Group says that between\nJune 2019 and June 2020, over 570 million Alipay users “purchased insurance or\nwere insured on our platform, or participated in Xianghubao mutual aid program”\n\nA big part of Ant Group’s growth in its insurance vertical comes from\nXianghubao, a standalone insurance product that also acts as a sort of\ntop-of-funnel for the group’s other insurance products. The product is well\ncovered in this SCMP article\n[https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3039554/ant-financials-mutual-aid-platform-xiang-hu-bao-attracts-100] \nfrom my friend, Georgina Lee.\n\nIn short, Xianghubao is, what Ant Group calls, a “mutual aid” or “collective\nclaim sharing” product. Anyone under 59 years old can sign up to protect against\n100 types of critical illness. It requires no upfront payments or premiums.\nHowever, whenever a claim is submitted by someone, all the other users of\nXianghubao will pay their approved claims. Per S1:\n\n> “If the claim is approved, the participant will receive a one-time payout, the\ncost of which is shared equally by all other participants. In 2019, the average\nannual contribution made by each Xianghubao participant to cover claims was\nRMB29 ($4).”\nPer insurance journal\n[https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2019/04/11/523411.htm]\n\n> Given the growing user base, every member should pay no more than 0.1 ($0.015)\nyuan for every critically ill person, according to Ant. It covers a list of no\nmore than 100 ailments. If a dispute over claims arises, a jury consisting of\nhundreds of thousands of pre-approved users will vote on whether to pay out\ncompensation.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the product had more than 100 million active members.\n\nAnd per the S1, it seems like this inexpensive product has made more Chinese\npeople aware of insurance product offerings and has led them to purchase other\nmore typical insurance products (i.e., those underwritten by an insurance\npartner).\n\nAnt’s other insurance products look similar to the scenario-based insurance\nproducts I’ve written about in Gojek\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/gojek] and Grab\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/grab] issues. Ant describes this as\n\n> “We have designed our scenario-based insurance products based on the unique\ncharacteristics of e-commerce transactions, i.e. low-ticket size with high\nfrequency.”\nThese low barriers to entry products are in line with what Ant did with their\ninvestment products and points to what I view as a broader product philosophy\nfor Ant.\n\nBuild a product in-house (for investment: Yu’ebao w/ Tianhong, for insurance:\nXianghubao), get the market comfortable with an inexpensive, low-friction\nproduct, and then open up to a marketplace of more sophisticated products,\npartnering with traditional financial institutions.\n\nPretty brilliant and repeatable playbook for other financial verticals. It also\nseems to stand in contrast to the western approach of starting off with partners\nand then building their own products to own the whole vertical stack.\n\nAnt Abroad\nCB Insights [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7KcRh2QjY] points out that Ant\nhas made many investments into international payment companies.\n\nOne could imagine the calculus that has made Chinese tech conglomerates (namely\nTencent and Alibaba/Ant Group) so dominant as investors is a belief of\nlocalization > globalization.\n\nThe upbringing of companies like Tencent and Ant Group where the Chinese\ngovernment clearly favored (and only really allowed) local players to win big\nmarkets, likely informed their thinking of how other markets might play out.\nAlibaba/Ant knew they wouldn’t win India, so they needed to invest in India’s\nwinner. And same for other big Asian, African, and LatAm markets. This is in\ncontrast to the approach of big western companies (i.e., Facebook, Google) where\nmuch of their success came from rapid global expansion and as a result, the idea\nof making big bets on the company that would e.g., win Japan seemed silly since\nthey were ultimately the one who would win Japan.\n\nIn that same CB insights presentation, they call out a quote from Alibaba\nco-founder, Joe Tsai on Ant Group’s broader vision to be a technology partner to\nmany different financial platforms, offering global, interoperable\ninfrastructure.\n\nRandom facts:\n 1. Alipay payment fraud loss rate was less than 0.0006 bps in the twelve months\n    ended June 30, 2020, which was the lowest payment fraud loss rate among\n    digital payments providers whose total payment volume exceeded US$500\n    billion in 2019, according to iResearch\n 2. Between December 31, 2019, and June 30, 2020, Alipay added 52 million\n    monthly active users bringing their MAU total to 711 million.\n\nConclusion\nThe case for investing in Ant is strong. It’s a household name throughout China,\nis growing its higher-margin sectors (e.g., credit) very quickly, and has unique\ndistribution throughout one of the world’s largest markets.\n\nThat said, there are a lot of risks present. (1) There has been increasing\nregulatory scrutiny of Ant, which they are working to minimize, but that is\nstill present. (2) It’s unclear when/if China launched a Central Bank Digital\nCurrency (“CBDC”) aka RMB on blockchain how Alipay will fit into that (3)\nTencent / WeChat Pay are a growing risk to Alipay. We’ve covered in the past how\nWeChat was able to crowd Baidu out of the search market as users turn to WeChat\nfor initial search inquires. It’s not hard to imagine WeChat doing the same to\npeople who currently turn to Alipay for financial offerings.\n\nIn the comments, please let me know what you think about this article and Ant\nGroup broadly!!\n\nAs always, thanks for reading!!!! 😁","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2020/10/ant.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-10-04T16:55:37.000Z","updated_at":"2020-10-04T16:59:09.000Z","published_at":"2020-10-04T16:59:09.000Z","custom_excerpt":"As Ant Group gears up for potentially the world's largest-ever IPO, people are wondering what the company does.

By 2013, even though China had more smartphone users than any other country, the country contributed almost no revenue to the music industry.</p><h2 id=\"tencent\">Tencent</h2><p>In 2014 Tencent began inking partnerships with record labels, specifically Warner Music and Sony, earning the right to manage the online distribution of music in China for two of the world’s largest music companies. However, after a decade of Chinese music lovers becoming accustomed to free music, it was tough to get them to pay. In 2014, QQ Music only <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60255bc6-e4c0-11e3-894f-00144feabdc0#axzz3IwI60Env\">had</a> 2.8M subscribers paying RMB 10 ($1.60) per month for ad-free streaming.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79ea5fd3-342f-4a57-a366-c6722616105f_1236x658.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>From the perspective of the entertainment companies, this was still a great first step at opening up content monetization in China. One of the unique things about the deals with Tencent is that while it gave Tencent exclusive distribution rights, Tencent also agreed to sublicense the rights to other streaming companies, often at a hefty markup.</p><p>Regardless of the sub-licensing agreements, it is clear why Tencent would be the ideal partner for a content company. Tencent could offer foreign companies more distribution and monetization options than any other company in China.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/warner-music-tencent-in-china-distribution-deal-1415869222\">with Warner</a>:</p><blockquote>“While QQ Music can feature Warner’s artists more prominently, Tencent’s <strong>concert-ticketing service</strong> can also launch promotions when Warner artists tour in China.</blockquote><blockquote>JD.com Inc.—China’s second-largest online shopping company, in which Tencent has a 15% stake—<strong>could sell digital music, T-shirts and other items</strong> from Warner musicians, the people said.”</blockquote><p>Tencent offers foreign partners the ability to plug into the Chinese market via its many distribution (and monetization) channels. In some cases, they can even help you build a <a href=\"https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-china-and-tencent-joint-cooperation-will-bring-gigantic-benefit-for-both\">factory</a> (especially when 90% of the challenge is political).</p><p>One year after the agreements with the record labels, in the summer of 2015, the Chinese government’s copyright agency <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/931287.shtml\">announced</a> stricter rules on music streaming, giving platforms &lt;30 days to remove unlicensed music.  <em>“The administration added that the move was in line with China's copyright law and regulations. <strong>Those who do not follow the order will be seriously punished,</strong> it said.” </em>One has to wonder if Tencent was tipped off about this regulation or did some lobbying for its creation.</p><p>This was the point at which the music industry in China flipped in Tencent’s favor. Tencent had spent the past year signing exclusive distribution partnerships with two of the world’s big 3 record labels and had a catalog that the rest of the streaming companies in China would struggle to compete with without a full-on bidding war.</p><p>But one other company took a similar strategy…</p><h2 id=\"china-music-corporation-\">China Music Corporation:</h2><p>In the background of all of Tencent’s activities, another company, “China Music Corporation” (aka “Ocean Music”) founded by former music industry lawyer, Xie Guomin, was also snapping up music <a href=\"https://m.pedaily.cn/news/436357\">copyright agreements</a> and had an almost equal amount of song rights as Tencent did by 2015. While Tencent signed a few licensing deals with the largest record labels, China Music Corporation (“CMC”) was signing hundreds of agreements with much smaller record labels.</p><p>The history of <em>China Music Corporation</em> is a bit murky, but it appears China Music Corporation (“CMC”) had no operations of its own in its early years and was strictly a copyright hoarder of music rights.</p><p>In 2013, China Music Corporation, with the support of a private equity investor purchased Kuwo, which at the time was the third-largest streaming service in China.</p><p>In 2014, China Music Corporation then also purchased Kugou, the #1 streaming service in China.</p><p><em>(For more on the history of CMC, there is an <a href=\"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/3-2018-12-05-Pltf-Mem-ISO-Petition.pdf\">insane write up</a> from the South District of NY as a result of a lawsuit from China Music Corp’s first investor who was defrauded of his shares and threatened by fake Chinese government agents</em>😲<em>).</em></p><p>Following these two acquisitions, in the summer of 2016, as CMC -- now the owner of 2 of the 3 of China’s largest music streaming services -- was rumored to be prepping for an IPO in the U.S., Tencent purchased a majority (~60%) stake of CMC. Tencent spun off its QQ Music (along with another property, WeSing) into the new majority-owned entity and renamed CMC as “<strong>Tencent Music Entertainment Group</strong>”.</p><p>The Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88e39e60-4d78-11e6-88c5-db83e98a590a\">revealed</a> that this Tencent / CMC courtship had been going on for about one year prior.</p><p>At the time of the merger, this struck observers as odd since CMC was doing about 2x the revenue of Tencent Music. China Music Corporation’s CEO, Xie Guomin, was prescient in describing the merger decision, and given that he previously worked at Sina (a Tencent competitor) he knew how Tencent liked to fight.</p><p>Mr. Xie was quoted,</p><blockquote>“We have more users today than Tencent, but if they chose to fight, and if they don’t care about the money, they can change their market share very quickly. They can pay ten times more than we can for content.”</blockquote><p>At the time of the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-to-buy-majority-stake-in-china-music-corp-creating-streaming-giant-1468470851\">acquisition</a></p><ul><li>Kugou was the largest mobile-music service in China, with a 28% market share,</li><li>QQ Music was second with 15%,</li><li>and Kuwo was a close third with a 13% market share.</li></ul><p>The newly merged entity, valued at about $6 billion, held nearly 60% market share of China’s music streaming industry and crucially represented 60%+ of all available music rights in China.</p><p>To this day, Tencent Music continues to operate each of these applications separately. So while QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwo all offer the same content library, their differences are highlighted in the types of music listened to and the demographics of users on each platform.</p><ul><li>QQ Music skews towards people interested in popular, mainstream music (yuppies and city-dwellers). It’s mostly used by younger generations in tier 1 cities.</li><li>Kugou has the broadest userbase and has more penetration in lower-tier cities.</li><li>Kuwo has a particularly strong user base in Northern China, with a focus on “DJ mixes and children’s songs”.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f84c087-42f7-47ec-b8fc-ca2b598e6783_1034x536.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>But even with record labels striking deals with companies like Tencent and the Chinese government’s 2015 ruling against piracy, there was still limited willingness by consumers to pay for music services.</p><p>I believe this opposition to paying for music in China is what ultimately leads Tencent to figure out other paths for monetizing music.</p><p>To recap, a brief history of Tencent Music between 2003 and 2017:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe239ab02-ff65-4fc7-8a7c-1e276324ecee_1164x964.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><h2 id=\"spotify-and-tencent\">Spotify and Tencent</h2><p>In September of 2017, it was reported that Tencent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/15/spotify-tencent/\">tried</a> to buy Spotify to fuel its international expansion outside of China. This did not happen.</p><p>But a few months later, Spotify and <em>Tencent Music Group</em> agreed to swap equity with each other.</p><blockquote>“Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Spotify will exchange minority stakes for cash. Parent company Tencent will also buy an additional stake in Spotify through existing shares on the secondary market”</blockquote><p>Spotify received a 9% share of <em>Tencent Music Entertainment Group</em>. Tencent (parent company) received a 7.5% stake in Spotify, though, between Tencent and Tencent Music, the two affiliated companies would eventually own about 9% of Spotify, which currently makes them Spotify’s <a href=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SPOTIFY-TECHNOLOGY-S-A-42589613/company/\">third-largest shareholder</a>.</p><p>Spotify CEO, Daniel Ek <a href=\"https://br.reuters.com/article/us-spotify-tencent/spotify-and-tencent-music-to-buy-stakes-in-each-other-idUSKBN1E2214\">said</a>,</p><blockquote>“This transaction will allow both companies to benefit from the global growth of music streaming,”</blockquote><p>As far as I am aware, equity swaps like this are not common (??). This swap made sense in my view because:</p><ol><li>Spotify could not enter China on its own. Tencent Music’s IPO documents point out within China:</li></ol><blockquote>“<strong>Foreign investors are prohibited from investing in companies engaged in certain online and culture related businesses, internet audio- visual programs businesses</strong>, internet culture businesses and radio and television program production businesses.”</blockquote><p>This is a genuinely interesting regulation in itself and it points out that it is illegal in China for a company engaged in defining culture to have foreign ownership, as Spotify certainly does.</p><p>Now you might say, well isn’t Tencent Music owned by both Spotify (10%) and other foreign investors via its Nasdaq IPO? That’s a topic for potentially a whole other issue, but if you’re interested in the controversial “Variable Interest Entity Structure” (“VIE”), you can take a tangent <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/tencent-music-isnt-actually-a-chinese-company-why-should-the-global-music-business-care/\">here</a>.</p><ol><li>Even though Tencent Music and Spotify might look like similar businesses, their revenues tell a much different story. I think Spotify gains a lot from a closer relationship with Tencent Music and learning from their playbook of integrating social experiences with music.</li><li>This also gives the two companies additional leverage as they negotiate with the record labels. Tencent eventually ‘bought’ even more leverage, when in 2019 Tencent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-31/tencent-group-clinches-deal-for-10-of-vivendi-s-universal-music?sref=H3VOPQIG\">bought</a> 10% of Universal Music Group for $3.4 billion and <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/06/china-tencent-music-stake-warner-music-group-1202957748/\">5.2% of Warner Music Group</a> in 2020.</li><li>The equity swap happened in 2017 prior to each company’s IPO and many believed it would be bullish for the companies to show an alliance leading up to their public offerings.</li><li>I think Spotify sets a good precedent here for a novel approach to gaining exposure to the Chinese market via owning equity of a market leader that would otherwise be a direct competitor. The road of foreign companies trying to enter China is littered with dead bodies. Having seen the failure of Google and Facebook to meaningfully enter China and the mixed results of younger companies like Uber, foreign companies realize that entering China directly is a battle that might not be worth fighting.</li></ol><h2 id=\"constraint-breeds-creativity-comparing-spotify-and-tencent-music\">Constraint Breeds Creativity: Comparing Spotify and Tencent Music</h2><p>Before diving into this issue, I did not expect Spotify and Tencent Music to be much different. I expected Tencent Music to just be “the Spotify of China”. As I alluded to earlier, while they may look like similar companies, their revenues tell a different story.</p><p>Tencent Music borrows more characteristics from its parent company, Tencent than from Spotify. TMEG revenue streams resemble a social, user-generated content company, more than a music streaming app.</p><hr><p>Spotify’s business is pretty straightforward, listen for free with advertisement interruptions and other limitations or pay $9.99/month for ad-free listening.</p><p>As shown briefly below, for 2019, Spotify made $6.7bn in revenue, of which 90% came from subscriptions and 10% from advertisements. As of December 31, 2019, Spotify had 271M monthly active users, of which 124 million were premium subscribers.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5ea166a-07de-4d6c-85fd-45973d33019a_1294x294.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Tencent Music, on the other hand, looks much different. As of 2018, their premium music subscription ranged from only RMB 8-15 ($1.20-$2.25) per month. As a result, Tencent Music has about 1/12th as much subscription revenue as Spotify, even though TME has nearly 3.5x as many monthly active users as Spotify.</p><p>While Tencent Music is generating only about $500m/year on subscriptions and $500M/year on ads, it is generating $2.6bn (72% of total revenue) from <em><strong>music-centric social entertainment services</strong></em></p><p>In terms of average revenue per user (ARPU), Spotify’s 2019 Premium ARPU was €4.72 ($5.58) per month. This decreased from the previous year because of the growth in popularity of the Family Plan and an increase in the number of subscribers on free trials.</p><p>Tencent Music’s calculates AR<strong>P</strong>PU (per paying user) rather than ARPU so the number will be slightly higher, but regardless, their premium subscriber average revenue per paying user is still only RMB 9.3 ($1.39) per month. However, Tencent Music’s <strong>social entertainment ARPPU is MUCH higher at RMB 138.5 ($20.74)!! And that’s up 10% from the prior year.</strong></p><p>So, what exactly are <em><strong>music-centric social entertainment services</strong></em>?</p><p>In their IPO docs, Tencent Music describes the “music-centric social entertainment services” category as:</p><blockquote>“Primarily <strong>include virtual gift sales and premium memberships</strong>, both of which are seamlessly integrated into the comprehensive user experience offered by our social entertainment services.</blockquote><blockquote>For example, <strong>users can send virtual gifts to show appreciation to those who share their karaoke or live performances</strong>, providing performers with an effective channel to interact with their fans and an attractive way to monetize their performance.”</blockquote><p>Revenues in these “social entertainment services” are predominately driven from <strong>online karaoke </strong>and <strong>live streaming services</strong> where users buy virtual gifts for performers and entertainers along with premium memberships for karaoke and social experiences.</p><p>While both Kugou and Kuwo operate services called “Kugou Live” (launched December 2016) and “Kuwo Live” (launched March 2013), the majority of this revenue is driven through <strong>WeSing</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"karaoke-\">Karaoke🎤</h2><p>Tencent provides WeSing with user traffic and access to the WeChat social graph to turn WeSing into a highly social experience</p><blockquote><em>“We currently require users to register with and access services and functions on WeSing using their Weixin/WeChat or QQ accounts, as WeSing is primarily used by users to socialize with their friends on Weixin/Wechat or QQ through music.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Such linkage between WeSing and Weixin/WeChat or QQ has in turn also enriched Tencent’s content ecosystem by providing Weixin/WeChat or QQ users with convenient access to our content.”</em></blockquote><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa3476779-d12f-4938-b519-d9bdf06ebd91_1162x692.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>WeSing has a number of functions all built around, well… singing.</p><p>On WeSing users can sing duets with pre-recordings of celebrities or other users, have karaoke parties in virtual song rooms, challenge other users in online sing-offs, and request songs for artists or other users to sing live.</p><p>WeSing monetizes these functions through the sale of virtual gifts to reward good performances along with premium memberships that come with “<em><strong>value-added functions, such as higher soundtrack resolution, additional app themes, and access to vocal singing tutorial programs</strong>”.</em></p><h2 id=\"live-streaming-\">Live Streaming🖥</h2><p>Music streaming and live streaming feed very naturally off of each other. As an example, “when a live streaming performer on Kugou Live performs a song, a message bubble pops up instantaneously on Kugou Music notifying users listing to the same song”.</p><p>If you were watching a stream of your favorite musician, you’d be able to make a song request by sending them a virtual gift (that you paid for). Similarly, users are able to chat beneath a live stream and receive message priority based on how much they tip via virtual gifts (similar concept to <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/bits\">Twitch Bits</a>).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ea9da6e-25b7-4df5-9857-66ce1f2a4d2f_1156x691.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>This relatively easy way to engage with and monetize fans seems it would be especially useful for up and coming artists that have smaller, but loyal fanbases.</p><p>In some sense, the success of these ‘social entertainment’ revenue streams for Tencent Music highlights a cultural difference between the East and West in terms of content and creator business models (not to mention a difference in their love of Karaoke). Content creators and publications in the West tend to monetize through either subscription or advertising. In China, there is much more of a tipping culture for creators that fit wells with the content produced via Karaoke and live streaming.</p><p>I wrote briefly about tipping within China in <a href=\"https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-part-2\">WeChat Part 2</a> and the kerfuffle it caused between Apple and Tencent.</p><blockquote><em>“Flashback to 2017 when tipping [for content] was taking off within WeChat. Tencent was not taking any service fees on tips and Apple made them disable their tipping function because Apple considered the tips to be in-app purchases”</em></blockquote><p>It’s actually unclear to me how Apple handles tipping and gifts within Tencent Music apps, but presumably, there is some kind of special agreement there, as well.</p><p><em>P.S., For more info around live streaming and the tipping dynamic in China, check out the documentary, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B07KY7YFNJ/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r\">People’s Republic of Desire</a>. It’s free on Amazon Prime Video. This documentary is a much darker view of the dynamic than I outlined above.</em></p><h2 id=\"spotify-social\">Spotify Social</h2><p>In the West, there is a generally under-tapped market by musicians and podcasters (broadly, “creators”) to monetize their audiences.</p><p>While platforms like Patreon provide one route for creators to offer exclusive content to their users, it seems this premium content would be better suited natively to a platform like Spotify.</p><p>Since Spotify is making a big push on podcasting, I’ll focus a bit more on that type of audio content (rather than music).</p><p>For podcasts, popular monetization paths are:</p><ol><li>Advertisements (e.g., Joe Rogan and Tim Ferriss)</li><li>Subscriptions (e.g., Sam Harris for $50/year)</li><li>Live Events (e.g., Sam Harris <a href=\"https://www.stubhub.com/sam-harris-and-the-waking-up-podcast-tickets/performer/100273910/\">hosted</a> sold-out live podcast tapings all over the world circa 2018)</li><li>Merchandise (e.g., comedian Brendan Schaub’s podcast has an associated clothing brand ‘<a href=\"https://www.thefighterandthekidshop.com/collections/thiccc-boy\">Thicc Boy</a>’. I actually saw my friend wearing one of their sweatshirts recently)</li></ol><p><em>(Similar for music, but swap advertising/subscriptions for licensing/record sales)</em></p><p>The Chinese behavior of ‘tipping’ your favorite creators could be a difficult behavioral change for the average western consumer (though not impossible, given the success of Twitch).</p><p>Within podcasting, it seems like the better V1 opportunity is less immediately social than TME, but still trending in that direction.</p><p>Spotify could offer the ability to subscribe to your favorite podcasters’ premium feed in-app. This would decrease the activation energy required for a user to start paying for a creator’s content directly. This also begins to open up the door to more social experiences, such as ‘fan clubs’ for creators.</p><p>I imagine the experience would be comparable to Substack.

Spotify could offer Andrew Schulz subscribers to listen to individual paywalled episodes for $3/episode. This would give people a cheap way to sample a creator’s premium offerings.</p><p><strong>The most notable hurdle here is Apple’s fee on in-app payments, potentially making this less lucrative for Spotify.</strong></p><p>Given that Spotify also seems to be making a push for more video content (see: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249389/spotify-video-podcast-test-upload-content-test-youtube\">May 2020 beta testing</a> and video being a part of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263927/joe-rogan-spotify-experience-exclusive-content-episodes-youtube\">the Joe Rogan deal</a>), this seems like it would be a path for creators to offer either exclusive live streams to paying fans or exclusive video as a part of a bundle of offerings. This would be similar to the ‘fan clubs’ offered within Tencent Music.</p><p>I believe COVID + improvements in live streaming (Zoom, etc.) has increased people’s willingness to pay for live digital events.</p><p>For example, again in the comedy podcaster realm (which seems to be very innovative), ‘<em>Your Mom’s House’</em> (a podcast by a comedian husband and wife) has been hosting live video events that cost $10/person. They also built a site (<a href=\"http://ymhvirtual.com/\">http://ymhvirtual.com/</a>) where upcoming and past event links live. Doing some napkin math, it seems like the average YouTube video for their flagship podcast gets about 500,000 views so if even 1% of that converts to a $10 live stream, that’s $50,000. That number is likely much higher as the 500,000 views undersell their whole reach since it’s not inclusive of people who listen to only the podcast and don’t watch the video.</p><p>I believe similar dynamics could exist for musicians. There is added complexity for musicians because of the complex agreements they have with record labels, but let’s assume <a href=\"http://kanyecontract.com/\">Kanye West fixes all that</a>, and let’s keep things simple for argument’s sake (and since I’m not a music/legal expert).</p><p>Take a look at BTS (the Korean boyband and one of the most popular music groups on the planet). Through the app WEVERSE (a Korean app for hosting content and artist-to-fan comms), BTS hosts its “BTS Army Fanclub” where for between $22-$150 annually you can receive perks <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/heres-how-to-join-bts-global-official-fanclub-to-take-advantage-of-all-the-army-perks-18197727\">such as</a>:</p><ol><li>Early access to purchase more “membership-only BTS goods”</li><li>Ability to purchase exclusive content</li><li>Early opportunity to buy tickets</li><li>Ability to participate in online and offline events</li><li>Membership kit (which includes a blanket, poster, and photo of some sorts)</li></ol><p>Now I’ll be honest, this does not sound like a great deal. It mostly sounds like you’re paying for the opportunity to buy more stuff.</p><p>However, you can envision a better version of this where you can pay $60/year for a ‘fan club’ subscription to your favorite artists that includes e.g., a limited print poster or t-shirt, a few live streams per year, quarterly AMAs with your favorite musician where you (as a subscriber) can pre-submit questions, early access to concert tickets, etc. And this whole, highly social experience would live within the Spotify platform.</p><p>On top of $10/month for your regular Spotify premium membership, fans would be another $5+/month for additional content from their favorite artists.</p><p>One example from <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-customers-come-for-the-music-stay-for-the-perks-1433869369\">Tencent Music</a>,</p><blockquote>“In March, Ms. Ye went to a members-only concert in Shenzhen where TFBoys sang in front of thousands of screaming fans. “I pay because I want to support TFBoys.

Some Instagram live streams will be able to introduce “Badges” that fans can buy to show their loyalty and support.

One of the top learning\nis that Tencent is one of the world’s best technology investors. A few weeks\nback I started putting together a sheet to map Tencent’s ownership stakes in\nother companies. I was quickly overwhelmed.\n\nFrom a 5% stake in Tesla to a 40% share of Epic Games, Tencent knows how to\ninvest, leverage its distribution, and make connections in China to help\ncompanies enter and win in 中国 (the middle kingdom).\n\nAs Niko Partners points out in a report\n[https://nikopartners.com/tencent-games-strategy/], in just gaming, Tencent has\n30+ investments in basically all the major game developers.\n\nToday we’re talking about Tencent Music Entertainment Group, its relation to\nSpotify, and what the future of Spotify might look like.\n\nThroughout the article, I refer to Tencent Music Entertainment Group as “Tencent\nMusic”, “$TME”, “TMEG”, and “QQ Music”.\n\nHistory of Tencent Music\nAround the launch of the iTunes Music Store in 2003, Tencent’s QQ messenger\n(somewhat of a precursor to WeChat, covered briefly in an earlier issue\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-a-not-so-brief-history]) launched\nmusic services.\n\nIn 2005 music services were spun out into a standalone product, “QQ Music”.\n\nBetween 2003 – 2006, several other music/MP3 services launched in China,\nincluding, Kugou, Kuwo, Xiami Music, and Baidu’s MP3 service.\n\nIn the decade between 2003 and 2013, China’s music industry was characterized by\nrampant piracy. By 2013, even though China had more smartphone users than any\nother country, the country contributed almost no revenue to the music industry.\n\nTencent\nIn 2014 Tencent began inking partnerships with record labels, specifically\nWarner Music and Sony, earning the right to manage the online distribution of\nmusic in China for two of the world’s largest music companies. However, after a\ndecade of Chinese music lovers becoming accustomed to free music, it was tough\nto get them to pay. In 2014, QQ Music only had\n[https://www.ft.com/content/60255bc6-e4c0-11e3-894f-00144feabdc0#axzz3IwI60Env] \n2.8M subscribers paying RMB 10 ($1.60) per month for ad-free streaming.\n\nFrom the perspective of the entertainment companies, this was still a great\nfirst step at opening up content monetization in China. One of the unique things\nabout the deals with Tencent is that while it gave Tencent exclusive\ndistribution rights, Tencent also agreed to sublicense the rights to other\nstreaming companies, often at a hefty markup.\n\nRegardless of the sub-licensing agreements, it is clear why Tencent would be the\nideal partner for a content company. Tencent could offer foreign companies more\ndistribution and monetization options than any other company in China.\n\nFor example, with Warner\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/warner-music-tencent-in-china-distribution-deal-1415869222]\n:\n\n> “While QQ Music can feature Warner’s artists more prominently, Tencent’s \nconcert-ticketing service can also launch promotions when Warner artists tour in\nChina.\n> JD.com Inc.—China’s second-largest online shopping company, in which Tencent has\na 15% stake—could sell digital music, T-shirts and other items from Warner\nmusicians, the people said.”\nTencent offers foreign partners the ability to plug into the Chinese market via\nits many distribution (and monetization) channels. In some cases, they can even\nhelp you build a factory\n[https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-china-and-tencent-joint-cooperation-will-bring-gigantic-benefit-for-both] \n(especially when 90% of the challenge is political).\n\nOne year after the agreements with the record labels, in the summer of 2015, the\nChinese government’s copyright agency announced\n[https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/931287.shtml] stricter rules on music\nstreaming, giving platforms <30 days to remove unlicensed music.“The\nadministration added that the move was in line with China's copyright law and\nregulations. Those who do not follow the order will be seriously punished, it\nsaid.” One has to wonder if Tencent was tipped off about this regulation or did\nsome lobbying for its creation.\n\nThis was the point at which the music industry in China flipped in Tencent’s\nfavor. Tencent had spent the past year signing exclusive distribution\npartnerships with two of the world’s big 3 record labels and had a catalog that\nthe rest of the streaming companies in China would struggle to compete with\nwithout a full-on bidding war.\n\nBut one other company took a similar strategy…\n\nChina Music Corporation:\nIn the background of all of Tencent’s activities, another company, “China Music\nCorporation” (aka “Ocean Music”) founded by former music industry lawyer, Xie\nGuomin, was also snapping up music copyright agreements\n[https://m.pedaily.cn/news/436357] and had an almost equal amount of song rights\nas Tencent did by 2015. While Tencent signed a few licensing deals with the\nlargest record labels, China Music Corporation (“CMC”) was signing hundreds of\nagreements with much smaller record labels.\n\nThe history of China Music Corporation is a bit murky, but it appears China\nMusic Corporation (“CMC”) had no operations of its own in its early years and\nwas strictly a copyright hoarder of music rights.\n\nIn 2013, China Music Corporation, with the support of a private equity investor\npurchased Kuwo, which at the time was the third-largest streaming service in\nChina.\n\nIn 2014, China Music Corporation then also purchased Kugou, the #1 streaming\nservice in China.\n\n(For more on the history of CMC, there is an insane write up\n[https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/3-2018-12-05-Pltf-Mem-ISO-Petition.pdf] \nfrom the South District of NY as a result of a lawsuit from China Music Corp’s\nfirst investor who was defrauded of his shares and threatened by fake Chinese\ngovernment agents😲).\n\nFollowing these two acquisitions, in the summer of 2016, as CMC -- now the owner\nof 2 of the 3 of China’s largest music streaming services -- was rumored to be\nprepping for an IPO in the U.S., Tencent purchased a majority (~60%) stake of\nCMC. Tencent spun off its QQ Music (along with another property, WeSing) into\nthe new majority-owned entity and renamed CMC as “Tencent Music Entertainment\nGroup”.\n\nThe Financial Times revealed\n[https://www.ft.com/content/88e39e60-4d78-11e6-88c5-db83e98a590a] that this\nTencent / CMC courtship had been going on for about one year prior.\n\nAt the time of the merger, this struck observers as odd since CMC was doing\nabout 2x the revenue of Tencent Music. China Music Corporation’s CEO, Xie\nGuomin, was prescient in describing the merger decision, and given that he\npreviously worked at Sina (a Tencent competitor) he knew how Tencent liked to\nfight.\n\nMr. Xie was quoted,\n\n> “We have more users today than Tencent, but if they chose to fight, and if they\ndon’t care about the money, they can change their market share very quickly.\nThey can pay ten times more than we can for content.”\nAt the time of the acquisition\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-to-buy-majority-stake-in-china-music-corp-creating-streaming-giant-1468470851]\n\n * Kugou was the largest mobile-music service in China, with a 28% market share,\n * QQ Music was second with 15%,\n * and Kuwo was a close third with a 13% market share.\n\nThe newly merged entity, valued at about $6 billion, held nearly 60% market\nshare of China’s music streaming industry and crucially represented 60%+ of all\navailable music rights in China.\n\nTo this day, Tencent Music continues to operate each of these applications\nseparately. So while QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwo all offer the same content\nlibrary, their differences are highlighted in the types of music listened to and\nthe demographics of users on each platform.\n\n * QQ Music skews towards people interested in popular, mainstream music\n   (yuppies and city-dwellers). It’s mostly used by younger generations in tier\n   1 cities.\n * Kugou has the broadest userbase and has more penetration in lower-tier\n   cities.\n * Kuwo has a particularly strong user base in Northern China, with a focus on\n   “DJ mixes and children’s songs”.\n\nBut even with record labels striking deals with companies like Tencent and the\nChinese government’s 2015 ruling against piracy, there was still limited\nwillingness by consumers to pay for music services.\n\nI believe this opposition to paying for music in China is what ultimately leads\nTencent to figure out other paths for monetizing music.\n\nTo recap, a brief history of Tencent Music between 2003 and 2017:\n\nSpotify and Tencent\nIn September of 2017, it was reported that Tencent tried\n[https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/15/spotify-tencent/] to buy Spotify to fuel its\ninternational expansion outside of China. This did not happen.\n\nBut a few months later, Spotify and Tencent Music Group agreed to swap equity\nwith each other.\n\n> “Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Spotify will exchange minority stakes for\ncash. Parent company Tencent will also buy an additional stake in Spotify\nthrough existing shares on the secondary market”\nSpotify received a 9% share of Tencent Music Entertainment Group. Tencent\n(parent company) received a 7.5% stake in Spotify, though, between Tencent and\nTencent Music, the two affiliated companies would eventually own about 9% of\nSpotify, which currently makes them Spotify’s third-largest shareholder\n[https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SPOTIFY-TECHNOLOGY-S-A-42589613/company/]\n.\n\nSpotify CEO, Daniel Ek said\n[https://br.reuters.com/article/us-spotify-tencent/spotify-and-tencent-music-to-buy-stakes-in-each-other-idUSKBN1E2214]\n,\n\n> “This transaction will allow both companies to benefit from the global growth of\nmusic streaming,”\nAs far as I am aware, equity swaps like this are not common (??). This swap made\nsense in my view because:\n\n 1. Spotify could not enter China on its own. Tencent Music’s IPO documents\n    point out within China:\n\n> “Foreign investors are prohibited from investing in companies engaged in certain\nonline and culture related businesses, internet audio- visual programs\nbusinesses, internet culture businesses and radio and television program\nproduction businesses.”\nThis is a genuinely interesting regulation in itself and it points out that it\nis illegal in China for a company engaged in defining culture to have foreign\nownership, as Spotify certainly does.\n\nNow you might say, well isn’t Tencent Music owned by both Spotify (10%) and\nother foreign investors via its Nasdaq IPO? That’s a topic for potentially a\nwhole other issue, but if you’re interested in the controversial “Variable\nInterest Entity Structure” (“VIE”), you can take a tangent here\n[https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/tencent-music-isnt-actually-a-chinese-company-why-should-the-global-music-business-care/]\n.\n\n 1. Even though Tencent Music and Spotify might look like similar businesses,\n    their revenues tell a much different story. I think Spotify gains a lot from\n    a closer relationship with Tencent Music and learning from their playbook of\n    integrating social experiences with music.\n 2. This also gives the two companies additional leverage as they negotiate with\n    the record labels. Tencent eventually ‘bought’ even more leverage, when in\n    2019 Tencent bought\n    [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-31/tencent-group-clinches-deal-for-10-of-vivendi-s-universal-music?sref=H3VOPQIG] \n    10% of Universal Music Group for $3.4 billion and 5.2% of Warner Music Group\n    [https://deadline.com/2020/06/china-tencent-music-stake-warner-music-group-1202957748/] \n    in 2020.\n 3. The equity swap happened in 2017 prior to each company’s IPO and many\n    believed it would be bullish for the companies to show an alliance leading\n    up to their public offerings.\n 4. I think Spotify sets a good precedent here for a novel approach to gaining\n    exposure to the Chinese market via owning equity of a market leader that\n    would otherwise be a direct competitor. The road of foreign companies trying\n    to enter China is littered with dead bodies. Having seen the failure of\n    Google and Facebook to meaningfully enter China and the mixed results of\n    younger companies like Uber, foreign companies realize that entering China\n    directly is a battle that might not be worth fighting.\n\nConstraint Breeds Creativity: Comparing Spotify and Tencent Music\nBefore diving into this issue, I did not expect Spotify and Tencent Music to be\nmuch different. I expected Tencent Music to just be “the Spotify of China”. As I\nalluded to earlier, while they may look like similar companies, their revenues\ntell a different story.\n\nTencent Music borrows more characteristics from its parent company, Tencent than\nfrom Spotify. TMEG revenue streams resemble a social, user-generated content\ncompany, more than a music streaming app.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpotify’s business is pretty straightforward, listen for free with advertisement\ninterruptions and other limitations or pay $9.99/month for ad-free listening.\n\nAs shown briefly below, for 2019, Spotify made $6.7bn in revenue, of which 90%\ncame from subscriptions and 10% from advertisements. As of December 31, 2019,\nSpotify had 271M monthly active users, of which 124 million were premium\nsubscribers.\n\nTencent Music, on the other hand, looks much different. As of 2018, their\npremium music subscription ranged from only RMB 8-15 ($1.20-$2.25) per month. As\na result, Tencent Music has about 1/12th as much subscription revenue as\nSpotify, even though TME has nearly 3.5x as many monthly active users as\nSpotify.\n\nWhile Tencent Music is generating only about $500m/year on subscriptions and\n$500M/year on ads, it is generating $2.6bn (72% of total revenue) from \nmusic-centric social entertainment services\n\nIn terms of average revenue per user (ARPU), Spotify’s 2019 Premium ARPU was\n€4.72 ($5.58) per month. This decreased from the previous year because of the\ngrowth in popularity of the Family Plan and an increase in the number of\nsubscribers on free trials.\n\nTencent Music’s calculates ARPPU (per paying user) rather than ARPU so the\nnumber will be slightly higher, but regardless, their premium subscriber average\nrevenue per paying user is still only RMB 9.3 ($1.39) per month. However,\nTencent Music’s social entertainment ARPPU is MUCH higher at RMB 138.5\n($20.74)!! And that’s up 10% from the prior year.\n\nSo, what exactly are music-centric social entertainment services?\n\nIn their IPO docs, Tencent Music describes the “music-centric social\nentertainment services” category as:\n\n> “Primarily include virtual gift sales and premium memberships, both of which are\nseamlessly integrated into the comprehensive user experience offered by our\nsocial entertainment services.\n> For example, users can send virtual gifts to show appreciation to those who\nshare their karaoke or live performances, providing performers with an effective\nchannel to interact with their fans and an attractive way to monetize their\nperformance.”\nRevenues in these “social entertainment services” are predominately driven from \nonline karaoke and live streaming services where users buy virtual gifts for\nperformers and entertainers along with premium memberships for karaoke and\nsocial experiences.\n\nWhile both Kugou and Kuwo operate services called “Kugou Live” (launched\nDecember 2016) and “Kuwo Live” (launched March 2013), the majority of this\nrevenue is driven through WeSing.\n\nKaraoke🎤\nTencent provides WeSing with user traffic and access to the WeChat social graph\nto turn WeSing into a highly social experience\n\n> “We currently require users to register with and access services and functions\non WeSing using their Weixin/WeChat or QQ accounts, as WeSing is primarily used\nby users to socialize with their friends on Weixin/Wechat or QQ through music.\n> Such linkage between WeSing and Weixin/WeChat or QQ has in turn also enriched\nTencent’s content ecosystem by providing Weixin/WeChat or QQ users with\nconvenient access to our content.”\nWeSing has a number of functions all built around, well… singing.\n\nOn WeSing users can sing duets with pre-recordings of celebrities or other\nusers, have karaoke parties in virtual song rooms, challenge other users in\nonline sing-offs, and request songs for artists or other users to sing live.\n\nWeSing monetizes these functions through the sale of virtual gifts to reward\ngood performances along with premium memberships that come with “value-added\nfunctions, such as higher soundtrack resolution, additional app themes, and\naccess to vocal singing tutorial programs”.\n\nLive Streaming🖥\nMusic streaming and live streaming feed very naturally off of each other. As an\nexample, “when a live streaming performer on Kugou Live performs a song, a\nmessage bubble pops up instantaneously on Kugou Music notifying users listing to\nthe same song”.\n\nIf you were watching a stream of your favorite musician, you’d be able to make a\nsong request by sending them a virtual gift (that you paid for). Similarly,\nusers are able to chat beneath a live stream and receive message priority based\non how much they tip via virtual gifts (similar concept to Twitch Bits\n[https://www.twitch.tv/bits]).\n\nThis relatively easy way to engage with and monetize fans seems it would be\nespecially useful for up and coming artists that have smaller, but loyal\nfanbases.\n\nIn some sense, the success of these ‘social entertainment’ revenue streams for\nTencent Music highlights a cultural difference between the East and West in\nterms of content and creator business models (not to mention a difference in\ntheir love of Karaoke). Content creators and publications in the West tend to\nmonetize through either subscription or advertising. In China, there is much\nmore of a tipping culture for creators that fit wells with the content produced\nvia Karaoke and live streaming.\n\nI wrote briefly about tipping within China in WeChat Part 2\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-part-2] and the kerfuffle it caused\nbetween Apple and Tencent.\n\n> “Flashback to 2017 when tipping [for content] was taking off within WeChat.\nTencent was not taking any service fees on tips and Apple made them disable\ntheir tipping function because Apple considered the tips to be in-app purchases”\nIt’s actually unclear to me how Apple handles tipping and gifts within Tencent\nMusic apps, but presumably, there is some kind of special agreement there, as\nwell.\n\nP.S., For more info around live streaming and the tipping dynamic in China,\ncheck out the documentary, People’s Republic of Desire\n[https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B07KY7YFNJ/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r]. It’s\nfree on Amazon Prime Video. This documentary is a much darker view of the\ndynamic than I outlined above.\n\nSpotify Social\nIn the West, there is a generally under-tapped market by musicians and\npodcasters (broadly, “creators”) to monetize their audiences.\n\nWhile platforms like Patreon provide one route for creators to offer exclusive\ncontent to their users, it seems this premium content would be better suited\nnatively to a platform like Spotify.\n\nSince Spotify is making a big push on podcasting, I’ll focus a bit more on that\ntype of audio content (rather than music).\n\nFor podcasts, popular monetization paths are:\n\n 1. Advertisements (e.g., Joe Rogan and Tim Ferriss)\n 2. Subscriptions (e.g., Sam Harris for $50/year)\n 3. Live Events (e.g., Sam Harris hosted\n    [https://www.stubhub.com/sam-harris-and-the-waking-up-podcast-tickets/performer/100273910/] \n    sold-out live podcast tapings all over the world circa 2018)\n 4. Merchandise (e.g., comedian Brendan Schaub’s podcast has an associated\n    clothing brand ‘Thicc Boy\n    [https://www.thefighterandthekidshop.com/collections/thiccc-boy]’. I\n    actually saw my friend wearing one of their sweatshirts recently)\n\n(Similar for music, but swap advertising/subscriptions for licensing/record\nsales)\n\nThe Chinese behavior of ‘tipping’ your favorite creators could be a difficult\nbehavioral change for the average western consumer (though not impossible, given\nthe success of Twitch).\n\nWithin podcasting, it seems like the better V1 opportunity is less immediately\nsocial than TME, but still trending in that direction.\n\nSpotify could offer the ability to subscribe to your favorite podcasters’\npremium feed in-app. This would decrease the activation energy required for a\nuser to start paying for a creator’s content directly. This also begins to open\nup the door to more social experiences, such as ‘fan clubs’ for creators.\n\nI imagine the experience would be comparable to Substack. Below is a screenshot\nfor a popular paid [https://www.lennyrachitsky.com/archive?sort=new] Substack.\n\nAs a non-paying subscriber, I can see that between September 18 and October 2,\nfive issues were published, though 4 of them are locked behind a paywall,\nwhereas 1 is free.\n\nOne content creator success story I’ve enjoyed watching during COVID has been\nthe comedian, Andrew Schulz\n[https://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh/status/1313472181108568064?s=20]. He’s been\ndoing standup for years, co-hosts a few podcasts, and has a YouTube channel.\nHe’s had a Patreon account since September 2018 and during COVID, his Patreon\nbecame the #3 highest-earning, making over $1mm/year.\n\nBelow is a screenshot from Andrew Schulz’s podcast feed on Spotify. He offers\nfree content on Spotify and paywalled content on Patreon at the moment.\n\nIn a future where Spotify begins offering a paid feed natively, anyone would be\nable to see that paywalled content exists (like in the Substack example), but\nnot be able to listen without a subscription (perhaps only a 10-minute preview).\n\nPeople who want to listen will be given the option to subscribe to Andrew Schulz\ndirectly (on top of their Spotify premium membership) with a 10-30% cut of that\nrevenue going to Spotify.\n\nCloser to the tipping model, Spotify could also play around with the idea of\nletting users purchase premium content on an episode-by-episode basis.\n\nLet’s say Andrew Schulz charges $5/month for his premium content and puts out 4\npremium episodes/month (so $1.25 per episode). Spotify could offer Andrew Schulz\nsubscribers to listen to individual paywalled episodes for $3/episode. This\nwould give people a cheap way to sample a creator’s premium offerings.\n\nThe most notable hurdle here is Apple’s fee on in-app payments, potentially\nmaking this less lucrative for Spotify.\n\nGiven that Spotify also seems to be making a push for more video content (see: \nMay 2020 beta testing\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249389/spotify-video-podcast-test-upload-content-test-youtube] \nand video being a part of the Joe Rogan deal\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263927/joe-rogan-spotify-experience-exclusive-content-episodes-youtube]\n), this seems like it would be a path for creators to offer either exclusive\nlive streams to paying fans or exclusive video as a part of a bundle of\nofferings. This would be similar to the ‘fan clubs’ offered within Tencent\nMusic.\n\nI believe COVID + improvements in live streaming (Zoom, etc.) has increased\npeople’s willingness to pay for live digital events.\n\nFor example, again in the comedy podcaster realm (which seems to be very\ninnovative), ‘Your Mom’s House’ (a podcast by a comedian husband and wife) has\nbeen hosting live video events that cost $10/person. They also built a site (\nhttp://ymhvirtual.com/) where upcoming and past event links live. Doing some\nnapkin math, it seems like the average YouTube video for their flagship podcast\ngets about 500,000 views so if even 1% of that converts to a $10 live stream,\nthat’s $50,000. That number is likely much higher as the 500,000 views undersell\ntheir whole reach since it’s not inclusive of people who listen to only the\npodcast and don’t watch the video.\n\nI believe similar dynamics could exist for musicians. There is added complexity\nfor musicians because of the complex agreements they have with record labels,\nbut let’s assume Kanye West fixes all that [http://kanyecontract.com/], and\nlet’s keep things simple for argument’s sake (and since I’m not a music/legal\nexpert).\n\nTake a look at BTS (the Korean boyband and one of the most popular music groups\non the planet). Through the app WEVERSE (a Korean app for hosting content and\nartist-to-fan comms), BTS hosts its “BTS Army Fanclub” where for between\n$22-$150 annually you can receive perks such as\n[https://www.elitedaily.com/p/heres-how-to-join-bts-global-official-fanclub-to-take-advantage-of-all-the-army-perks-18197727]\n:\n\n 1. Early access to purchase more “membership-only BTS goods”\n 2. Ability to purchase exclusive content\n 3. Early opportunity to buy tickets\n 4. Ability to participate in online and offline events\n 5. Membership kit (which includes a blanket, poster, and photo of some sorts)\n\nNow I’ll be honest, this does not sound like a great deal. It mostly sounds like\nyou’re paying for the opportunity to buy more stuff.\n\nHowever, you can envision a better version of this where you can pay $60/year\nfor a ‘fan club’ subscription to your favorite artists that includes e.g., a\nlimited print poster or t-shirt, a few live streams per year, quarterly AMAs\nwith your favorite musician where you (as a subscriber) can pre-submit\nquestions, early access to concert tickets, etc. And this whole, highly social\nexperience would live within the Spotify platform.\n\nOn top of $10/month for your regular Spotify premium membership, fans would be\nanother $5+/month for additional content from their favorite artists.\n\nOne example from Tencent Music\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-customers-come-for-the-music-stay-for-the-perks-1433869369]\n,\n\n> “In March, Ms. Ye went to a members-only concert in Shenzhen where TFBoys sang\nin front of thousands of screaming fans. “I pay because I want to support\nTFBoys. If there’s anything I can do for them, I will,” she said, waving a\nbanner with the band members’ names.”\nAs I was writing this post, Instagram shared that it would begin helping its\ncontent creators monetize in new and social ways. Some Instagram live streams\nwill be able to introduce “Badges” that fans can buy to show their loyalty and\nsupport. Per TechCrunch\n[https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/instagram-rolls-out-fan-badges-for-live-videos-expands-igtv-ads-test/]\n:\n\n> “Instagram users will see three options to purchase a badge during live videos:\nbadges that cost $0.99, $1.99, or $4.99.\n> On Instagram Live, badges will not only call attention to the fans’ comments,\nthey also unlock special features, Instagram says. This includes a placement on\na creator’s list of badge holders and access to a special heart badge.\n> The badges and list make it easier for creators to quickly see which fans are\nsupporting their efforts, and give them a shout-out, if desired.”\n(Photo: From TechCrunch)\n\nThis is another path Spotify could consider, where music and e.g., ‘karaoke’\ninfluencers could leverage Spotify’s music distribution rights to make a brand\nfor themselves on the Spotify platform. This, however, feels like much more of a\nstretch as this turns Spotify into more of a user-generated content app.\n\nEven though podcasts are mostly user-generated (i.e., not produced by big\nstudios), there is still a barrier to entry in podcasting that is higher than\nTikTok (which Karaoke videos are more akin to).\n\nUltimately, there is a wide gap between where Spotify and Tencent Music each\ncurrently sit. Spotify does not need to jump all the way across that spectrum\nbut can begin making progress to becoming more social.\n\nAs told by their revenues, Spotify is a subscription music service and Tencent\nMusic is a user-generated-content (UGC) company focused on Karaoke and\nlive-streaming with music subscriptions as an ancillary source of revenue.\nTrying to transform Spotify into a more UGC-driven company would be a step too\nfar, but leveraging their existing partnerships and relationships with creators,\nthey could build new social channels around those individuals and give them new\nways to interact with and monetize their fans.\n\nSpotify seems to be taking some steps in this direction, but not with the\nexperiences actually living on their platform. In September 2020, Spotify\nannounced a “virtual events” listing service but, ticketing is happening through\na third-party platform (Songkick) and the streams are taking place on other\nplatforms (Twitch, YouTube, etc.). In some ways, this is just the digital\nequivalent of Spotify’s previous “Concerts” feature where you could search for\nlocal concerts in your area and then purchase tickets through Ticketmaster, etc.\n\nSince its earliest days, Spotify has throttled the intersection of music and\nsocial. They were one of the first companies to build on Facebook Connect\n[https://genius.com/Sean-parker-sean-parker-s-email-to-spotifys-daniel-ek-annotated] \nand had a number of social features over the years that they’ve mostly killed\noff\n[https://musically.com/2017/02/28/spotify-is-removing-its-inbox-and-messaging-feature/]\n. Still, with collaborative playlists and Spotify’s viral end-of-year recaps,\nthey are one of the most socially-conscious Western content companies.\n\nAn exciting next chapter for Spotify would be to build upon the social elements\nlaid out by other platforms like Tencent Music to expand creators’ relationships\nwith their users and open up new monetization paths.\n\nThanks for reading! 💜\n\nIf you enjoy this post or any other posts, please consider sharing, commenting,\nor just giving the post a “<3” on Substack","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579460373382-a4a855d3ad52?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ","featured":1,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2020-10-26T19:35:45.000Z","updated_at":"2020-11-17T03:17:31.000Z","published_at":"2020-10-26T19:43:39.000Z","custom_excerpt":"A deep dive into the history, product, and strategy of Tencent Music, its relation to Spotify, and how Spotify can add social features in the future.

The firm then brings in new money to pay off the old money and the process repeats from there. They say, “<em>We just need to do this for one more quarter until we make enough money to get back to breakeven”</em>, but that never happens.</li><li><strong>OR</strong> From day one, the company decides that it will not have legitimate business operations and that it will lie to consumers about how it generates yield and will only operate a Ponzi scheme.</li></ol><p>I feel like you don’t see many of #2.</p><p>It’s even debated what Bernie Madoff was, but the speculation I recall was that he was a case of #1 where he started as a legitimate operation and became a Ponzi after a few decades of trading.</p><p>Ezubo seemed to be a case of #2.</p><p>Again, from the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-calls-lending-platform-ezubo-a-7-6-billion-ponzi-scheme-1454313780\">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote><em>“prosecutors said that Ezubo didn’t invest the money it collected, but rather used it to pay down earlier debt—and to fund lavish lifestyles for [the CEO] and several female executives. <strong>Mr. Ding [the CEO] allegedly gave one favored colleague a 130 million-yuan ($19.7 million) villa in Singapore, a pink diamond worth 12 million-yuan ($1.8 million), luxury cars and 550 million yuan ($82.5 million) in cash.</strong>”</em></blockquote><p><strong>Really</strong>, not even trying.</p><p>Following Ezubo’s demise, the cracks in other platforms began to show.

This makes sense putting the numbers above into context. They don’t have as many customers as Ant or Tencent, but they do have larger loan amounts.</p><p>The worst dimension on which Lufax is different than the FinTech offerings from Ant and Tencent is that it does not have the same differentiated distribution channels that Ant Group (via Alipay) and Tencent (via WeChat) do. As a result, Lufax looks more like a traditional financial institution.

And we should also not discount the head start they were given from their majority shareholder, Ping An.</p><p>Something generally to note about Lufax that is similar to Ant and WeChat is that all of them started within or with the support of existing giant companies. Ant is a semi-spinout of Alibaba, Lufax was started within and with the support of Ping An Group, and WeChat (and its FinTech offerings) was birthed within Tencent.</p><p>It’s tough to make a bet on Lufax in the face of Ant Group and Tencent’s wealth management and credit products. Lufax becomes a clearer bet if China <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a4a5001-6411-45fa-967c-0fd71ba9300b\">continues</a> to pursue antitrust actions against Alibaba and Tencent.</p><p>That said, Lufax is vulnerable to any additional restrictions that the government puts on the rates they are able to charge on loans. It’s also possible that CCP restrictions intended to harm Ant could hurt Lufax as collateral damage.</p><p>For now at least, as the Ant Group IPO was suspended and Chinese regulators announced they’d begin to focus on anti-competitive behaviors in the tech industry, Lufax shares rose as shares of Alibaba and Tencent fell.</p><h2 id=\"news-recap\">News Recap</h2><p>Since many of the companies I’ve done deep dives on (Grab, Gojek, Tencent Music) are still very much writing their histories, I want to use this section to highlight interesting news from each along with other Asia news that I think should be on your radar.</p><hr><p>China’s P2P and an SF-based Crypto lending company (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/busted-hedges-alleged-fraud-bankrupt-silicon-valley-crypto-firm\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://cryptobriefing.com/behind-shroud-creds-tragic-bankruptcy/\">Cryptobriefing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/bad-loans-bad-bets-bad-blood-how-crypto-lender-cred-really-went-bankrupt\">Coindesk</a>)</p><ul><li>While I was writing this article, another company with ties to China’s P2P industry blew up.</li><li>Cred, a San Francisco-based crypto company that offers you yield on idle cryptos (i.e., they will pay you 8% annually if you lend them your bitcoin) filed for bankruptcy.</li><li>Cred generates yield by taking the Bitcoin you lend them and then lending it to other partners who will pay Cred 10%+.

This was on the back of the launch of Zopa in the\nUK in 2005 and LendingClub in the US in 2006.\n\nIn its purest form (and to oversimplify a bit), P2P lending is connecting people\nthat have capital directly with people who need capital. While the connector\nwill usually charge some fee, part of the promise is that you are still cutting\nout a more extractive middle man (often a bank).\n\n * For lenders, the benefit is that you can earn a higher rate of return by\n   lending directly to someone on a P2P platform than you would by depositing\n   your funds in a bank (which would also lend out the capital but would keep\n   most of the yield for itself).\n * The borrowers who benefit most from P2P platforms are people who would\n   otherwise not be approved for a bank loan, in general, these are riskier\n   clients\n\nChina’s financial industry (circa ’05 – ’15) was particularly well-suited for\nP2P and micro-lending.\n\n 1. China’s (mostly) state-owned banks were very risk-averse and historically\n    did not lend money to individuals and small businesses. In fact, they mostly\n    only loaned money to other state-owned entities.\n 2. China lacked an established credit bureau so there was minimal credit\n    history data, which made vetting borrowers tough.\n 3. China boasted (and still does boast) a high average savings rate but --\n    especially in the early 2010s -- did not have robust investment\n    opportunities. For perspective, the average savings rate in China is between\n    40-50%, compared to the U.S. where it is <10%.\n\nThe P2P industry was willing to take on risk and provide credit to individuals\nand small businesses, while also offering high yield investment opportunities to\nChina’s millions of savers.\n\nI’ve read highly conflicting numbers, but near the peak in 2016/2017, there were\nsomewhere between 4,000 – 7,000 P2P and micro-lending platforms operating in\nChina, doing nearly 130 billion RMB ($19 billion) in volume per month.\n\nThere was a big opportunity to do something meaningful and expand the lending\nmarket in China to more individuals and small businesses. But the frenzy got the\nbest of people. Like any good speculative bubble, the industry quickly attracted\nmany fraudsters.\n\nThere were all kinds of things wrong with how the industry was being run in\nChina. Corporate funds were co-mingled with funds that were supposed to be\nsegregated for borrowers, returns were guaranteed by the companies, and\ncompanies were rarely acting as just a matchmaker or escrow agent of the client\nfunds. Without any kind of standards, purely fraudulent entities were able to\namass billions of dollars of customer funds.\n\nThe problems of the industry were best displayed by the industry’s leader in\n2016, Ezubo.\n\nEzubo\nThe biggest blow-up happened in February 2016, when it was uncovered that Ezubo,\nwhich was the largest P2P lender in China at the time, was actually a giant\nPonzi scheme.\n\nAt its height, Ezubo had raised RMB 59 billion (US$9 billion) from nearly\n1,000,000 individuals throughout China.\n\nAs the Beijing police said:\n\n> “Ezubo had lured investors with promises of high-interest payouts from leasing\nprojects. It quoted company officials saying 95% of the advertised investment\nprojects were falsified and calling Ezubo “a downright Ponzi scheme.”\nAs the WSJ showed at the time, investors lined up at government offices to try\nand get recourse for their lost funds\n\nToday, Ezubo’s founders are serving life sentences in prison while 25 former\nemployees are serving sentences of 3-15 years. At the time of arrest, the\ncompany had failed to meet repayments on RMB 38 billion (US$5.7 billion).\n\nIn reality, Ezubo was not doing P2P lending in the way it is widely understood.\nThey told lenders\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-calls-lending-platform-ezubo-a-7-6-billion-ponzi-scheme-1454313780] \nthat they’d be offering ‘finance leasing’ where Ezubo would buy manufacturing\nequipment using the lenders’ money and then lease that equipment to e.g.,\nfarmers who would provide a stream of income from leasing payments. Annual\nyields were quoted in the 9-15% range.\n\nNow, from what I’ve read on Ponzi schemes, they seem to start in one of two\nways:\n\n 1. It does not start as a Ponzi, but something goes wrong (back-to-back bad\n    quarters) and a firm can’t meet its expectations or obligations. The firm\n    then brings in new money to pay off the old money and the process repeats\n    from there. They say, “We just need to do this for one more quarter until we\n    make enough money to get back to breakeven”, but that never happens.\n 2. OR From day one, the company decides that it will not have legitimate\n    business operations and that it will lie to consumers about how it generates\n    yield and will only operate a Ponzi scheme.\n\nI feel like you don’t see many of #2.\n\nIt’s even debated what Bernie Madoff was, but the speculation I recall was that\nhe was a case of #1 where he started as a legitimate operation and became a\nPonzi after a few decades of trading.\n\nEzubo seemed to be a case of #2.\n\nAgain, from the WSJ\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-calls-lending-platform-ezubo-a-7-6-billion-ponzi-scheme-1454313780]\n:\n\n> “prosecutors said that Ezubo didn’t invest the money it collected, but rather\nused it to pay down earlier debt—and to fund lavish lifestyles for [the CEO] and\nseveral female executives. Mr. Ding [the CEO] allegedly gave one favored\ncolleague a 130 million-yuan ($19.7 million) villa in Singapore, a pink diamond\nworth 12 million-yuan ($1.8 million), luxury cars and 550 million yuan ($82.5\nmillion) in cash.”\nReally, not even trying.\n\nFollowing Ezubo’s demise, the cracks in other platforms began to show. Between\nJune and July of 2018, a total of about\n[https://www.digfingroup.com/fintech-china-2/] 250 P2P platforms defaulted.\n\nLenders, who normally had to wait for the term of their loan to expire before\nreceiving back their principal + interest were\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-16/panic-roils-china-s-p2p-lenders-as-savers-rush-to-withdraw-cash?sref=H3VOPQIG] \n“trying to exit early by selling their rights to others at a discount, or by\ngoing to the platform’s offices to demand repayment.”\n\nIn one extreme, local authorities in Hangzhou, China converted\n[https://www.ft.com/content/75e75628-8b27-11e8-bf9e-8771d5404543] two sports\nstadiums into a center where aggrieved P2P lenders could file claims with local\nauthorities against the companies that had disappeared with their funds.\n\nIt got to the point that even a state-sponsored P2P platform, Huoq, disappeared.\n\nHuoq launched in December 2016 with backing from state-owned Chinese\nenterprises, it then went into liquidation in July 2018, and the founders\ndisappeared with no one able to find them.\n\nThese ‘exit scams’ were common.\n\nBlomberg\n[https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/panic-roils-china-s-p2p-lenders-as-savers-rush-to-withdraw-cash] \nrecounted one users’ story at the time,\n\n> “David Gao, 30, who works in the financial industry in Beijing, invested 1\nmillion yuan (US$150,000) of his savings in P2P loans facilitated by a\nHangzhou-based platform in November and has been unable to retrieve his\nprincipal and interest. After traveling 700 miles to the company’s office with\nother investors last week, he found it deserted.”\n☹️\n\nRegulation\nFollowing the Ezubo blow-up, regulators finally\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-sets-ceilings-on-credit-issued-via-p2p-platforms-1472029311] \nstepped in with restrictions that included:\n\n 1. Limits on the amount individuals could borrow from one platform ($30,000)\n    and could borrow in total ($150,000)\n 2. Platforms needed to stop offering complementary products (e.g., insurance,\n    wealth management)\n 3. Platforms could only serve the role of matching borrowers and lenders (i.e.,\n    they could not take on principal risk, had to stop repackaging and selling\n    loans)\n 4. Platforms could not guarantee returns\n 5. Platforms needed to work with qualified custodians (e.g., banks) to hold\n    users funds, meaning platforms could no longer co-mingle loans with\n    corporate capital\n\nFollowing these regulations, it stripped the P2P companies of their ability to\noperate as ‘shadow banks’ (That is, “non-bank financial intermediaries that\nprovide services similar to traditional commercial banks but outside normal\nbanking regulations.”)\n\nThe biggest challenge on the business models of these platforms imposed by the\nregulations was that they banned these P2P platforms from doing anything other\nthan matching borrowers and lenders.\n\nLike many modern FinTech products globally, China’s P2P platforms began by\noffering one financial service (P2P) and then added more services until they\nwere able to offer a suite of financial products and services.\n\nOf the thousands of companies that were founded to capitalize on P2P lending in\nChina, four of them have made it public in the US stock markets. These include:\n\n * Yirendai (NYSE: YRD\n   [https://www.google.com/finance/quote/YRD:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjfjpHVheLsAhVInp4KHUAXDZIQ3ecFMAB6BAgDEBk]\n   , $305M Market cap)\n * PPDAI (NYSE: FINV\n   [https://www.google.com/finance/quote/FINV:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjIi9OShuLsAhWI_J4KHdXkA4kQ3ecFMAB6BAgCEBk]\n   , $383M Market cap)\n * Qudian (NYSE: QD [https://www.google.com/finance/quote/QD:NYSE], $340M Market\n   Cap)\n\nAnd then most recently, Lufax (NYSE: LU\n[https://www.google.com/finance/quote/LU:NYSE], ~$40 billion+ market cap).\n\nYirendai, PPDAI, and Qudian — which all went public between 2015 and 2017 — are\ndown between 80-100% from their 2017 highs.\n\nLufax is impressive in its ability to go through several reinventions to be able\nto thrive in a way that the other companies above have not been able to, but it\nstill faces steep headwinds.\n\nLufax:\nAfter 20 years at McKinsey, culminating as a Senior Partner in the firm’s\ngreater China practice and a stint as COO at a Taiwanese public company, \nGregory\nGibb\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E8%AE%A1%E8%91%B5%E7%94%9F%EF%BC%88greg-gibb%EF%BC%89-4318495a/?originalSubdomain=cn] \ntook on the role of ‘Chief Innovation Officer’ at Ping An.\n\nPing An is one of the largest companies in the world and is China’s largest\ninsurance company and conglomerate of financial, tech, and healthcare services.\nWhen Greg stepped into the role in 2011, he was quickly tasked with building\nPing An’s P2P lending product, and thus, Lufax was born\n[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1764380/mainland-chinas-peer-peer-pioneer-lauds-big-innovation-big-place] \nwith Greg taking over as the CEO and Co-Chairman.\n\nWith the support of Ping An, Lufax quickly rose to become China’s largest P2P\nlender as Ezubo was going through its blowup. Compared to their upstart\ncompetitors, Lufax was able to offer a higher level of trust, since they were\nable to (actually) guarantee loans as a result of Ping An’s balance sheet.\n\nLufax always viewed their role as more than just a facilitator of P2P lending.\nAs far back as 2014, Gibb was saying\n[https://www.lendacademy.com/the-most-important-chinese-p2p-lending-companies/] \nthat the goal was to build a large wealth management business and upsell Ping An\nproducts, using P2P as a cheap customer acquisition channel.\n\nIn 2015, Lufax’s product offerings were pretty straightforward\n[https://www.lendacademy.com/lufax-p2p-firm-china/], with both P2P and wealth\nmanagement products.\n\nThese included:\n\n 1. WenYing-An-e - an unsecured P2P loan with an average maturity of 1-3 years,\n    a minimum investment amount of $1,500, and a project annualized interest\n    rate of 7.84%+\n 2. WenYing-AnYe - a “real-estate-mortgaged” investment product with an average\n    maturity of 3-12 months, an investment minimum of $37,500, and a projected\n    interest rate of 7.5%-7.8%\n\n 1. FuYing RenSheng – An investment product for senior citizens with a minimum\n    investment amount of $150, a projected annual rate of return of 5.5%, and a\n    3-12-month duration\n 2. “Exclusive Wealth Management” – An investment product for preferred members\n    with a 15K minimum, 1-12-month duration, and expected annual returns of\n    15-20%.\n\nThese were likely generally indicative of other products that were on the market\nat the time.\n\nToday lending and wealth management have basically an equal number of users at\nLufax, but wealth management generates far fewer revenues.\n\nThe interesting story to be told in the lending numbers is the shift between the\npercentage of loans funded by third-parties (presumably, banks) vs. the\npercentage funded by Lufax.\n\nIn 2017 when the Chinese government added requirements that businesses become\nmere matchmakers of borrowers and lenders, Lufax was able to adjust faster than\ntheir competitors (likely stemming from their parent company’s existing\nrelationships).\n\nAs shown below, starting in 2017, the percentage of loans funded by Lufax vs\nthird-parties went from about 50/50 in 2017 to nearly 100/0 in 2019.\n\nSource: Public filingsToday, Lufax is the second largest (non-bank) provider of\nconsumer and small business loans in China, behind only Ant Group.\n\nSource: Oliver Wyman report cited in Lufax public filingsIn the (non-bank)\nwealth management business, they are the third-largest in China behind Ant Group\nand Tencent’s Licaitong (both covered in earlier issues on Ant\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/understanding-ant-group] and WeChat\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-part-2]).\n\nSource: Oliver Wyman report cited in Lufax public filingsAs a % of market share,\nLufax is a distant second in consumer lending, a distant third in wealth\nmanagement, but a close second in small business loans. Lufax also has much\nlarger loan sizes than its competitors, again likely as a result of the support\nof its largest shareholder, Ping An.\n\nLufax’s business is much more financial services and much less tech than the\nbusinesses of Ant and Tencent. This makes sense putting the numbers above into\ncontext. They don’t have as many customers as Ant or Tencent, but they do have\nlarger loan amounts.\n\nThe worst dimension on which Lufax is different than the FinTech offerings from\nAnt and Tencent is that it does not have the same differentiated distribution\nchannels that Ant Group (via Alipay) and Tencent (via WeChat) do. As a result,\nLufax looks more like a traditional financial institution. As an illustrative\nexample, compare the headcounts of Lufax and Ant Group.\n\nLufax employs about 5x as many total employees as Ant does with most of them in\nsales and marketing. Lufax also employs only about 1/10 the number of tech and\nR&D employees as Ant Group does.\n\nSource: Each company’s public filingsOf the 66,700 sales and marketing employees\nat Lufax,\n\n * 56,764 are in direct sales\n * 5,078 are in channel management\n * 4,239 are in online sales\n\nLufax has 695 offices in China. Presumably, most of this is not ‘corporate\noffice space’, but is inclusive of call-centers for its telemarketing staff and\nthe fact that Lufax operates\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-lufax-valued-at-nearly-10-billion-in-recent-funding-round-1429164241] \n~100 storefronts throughout China to complement its large salesforce.\n\nThe direct sales seem to work though, with 45% of Lufax’s 2019 loans (USD $33\nbillion) coming through that channel. Online and telemarketing accounted for the\nleast number of new loans, only ~12% of the 2019 total.\n\nGenerally good for companies like Lufax is the fact that household debt is\nquickly rising in China. The increased propensity for consumers in China to take\non debt along with small businesses potentially needing loans while rebounding\nfrom COVID could be a boon for Lufax’s business.\n\nSource: Rhodium Group\n[https://rhg.com/research/china-household-debt/#:~:text=China's%20recent%20household%20debt%20expansion,2008.]\nConclusion\nLufax deserves a ton of credit for competing against China’s two giants, Alibaba\n(Ant Group) and Tencent, and remaining competitive. And we should also not\ndiscount the head start they were given from their majority shareholder, Ping\nAn.\n\nSomething generally to note about Lufax that is similar to Ant and WeChat is\nthat all of them started within or with the support of existing giant companies.\nAnt is a semi-spinout of Alibaba, Lufax was started within and with the support\nof Ping An Group, and WeChat (and its FinTech offerings) was birthed within\nTencent.\n\nIt’s tough to make a bet on Lufax in the face of Ant Group and Tencent’s wealth\nmanagement and credit products. Lufax becomes a clearer bet if China continues\n[https://www.ft.com/content/1a4a5001-6411-45fa-967c-0fd71ba9300b] to pursue\nantitrust actions against Alibaba and Tencent.\n\nThat said, Lufax is vulnerable to any additional restrictions that the\ngovernment puts on the rates they are able to charge on loans. It’s also\npossible that CCP restrictions intended to harm Ant could hurt Lufax as\ncollateral damage.\n\nFor now at least, as the Ant Group IPO was suspended and Chinese regulators\nannounced they’d begin to focus on anti-competitive behaviors in the tech\nindustry, Lufax shares rose as shares of Alibaba and Tencent fell.\n\nNews Recap\nSince many of the companies I’ve done deep dives on (Grab, Gojek, Tencent Music)\nare still very much writing their histories, I want to use this section to\nhighlight interesting news from each along with other Asia news that I think\nshould be on your radar.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChina’s P2P and an SF-based Crypto lending company (Bloomberg\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/busted-hedges-alleged-fraud-bankrupt-silicon-valley-crypto-firm]\n, Cryptobriefing\n[https://cryptobriefing.com/behind-shroud-creds-tragic-bankruptcy/], Coindesk\n[https://www.coindesk.com/bad-loans-bad-bets-bad-blood-how-crypto-lender-cred-really-went-bankrupt]\n)\n\n * While I was writing this article, another company with ties to China’s P2P\n   industry blew up.\n * Cred, a San Francisco-based crypto company that offers you yield on idle\n   cryptos (i.e., they will pay you 8% annually if you lend them your bitcoin)\n   filed for bankruptcy.\n * Cred generates yield by taking the Bitcoin you lend them and then lending it\n   to other partners who will pay Cred 10%+.

This one does not seem to be specifically for the Chinese market and is a part of NetEase’s broader international expansion plans.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netease-pokemon/chinas-netease-to-launch-first-official-pokemon-game-in-china-idUSKCN1SQ0IM\">Pokémon</a> and NetEase are also developing the ‘first official Pokémon game in China’</li></ul><p>While NetEase does have some very high-profile JVs, most of the company’s revenues are still derived from its portfolio of about 150 in-house developed games. Mobile games are especially important for NetEase accounting for 71% of gaming revenues.</p><p>Writing this NetEase breakdown helps me to understand the value of intellectual property and the value of ‘cinematic universes’ in a much deeper way.</p><p>Besides licensing other company’s IP in China, NetEase has a plethora of in-house IP from its hundreds of mobile and PC based games. It’s begun to go past gaming, developing one of its hit games, Onmyoji into a <a href=\"https://mmoculture.com/2020/08/onmyoji-trailer-for-first-live-action-movie-revealed/\">feature film</a>.</p><p>NetEase also takes advantage of some “IP arbitrage” (perhaps, regulatory capture would be more accurate) where it can find popular global IP (e.g., Marvel Universe) and then work with Marvel to bring that content into China.</p><p>The regulators have made this practice even more pronounced in gaming where recent regulations have mandated that <em>“Foreign game companies must work with a domestic game publisher who will operate the game in China.”</em></p><p>The other IP arbitrage that someone like NetEase can capitalize on is taking a popular gameplay mechanism (i.e., League of Legends’ MOBA style of play) and creating a clone using Marvel IP. <em>Marvel Super War</em>, highlighted above, seems to follow that exact strategy.</p><p>In terms of building lucrative in-house IP, I glossed over the fact earlier that NetEase first released Fantasy Westworld Journey in 2001, and then in 2017 (16 years later) when the mobile versions of the game were released, NetEase was still able to generate US$1.5 billion in annual revenue.</p><p>As a Niko Partners report <a href=\"https://nikopartners.com/netease-games-strategy-a-free-report/\">highlights</a>:</p><blockquote><em>Legacy titles get expansion packs and new content regularly to keep players engaged. Fantasy Westward Journey has become an evergreen IP for the company and its revenue grew at a double-digit rate in 2019, despite being 15 years old and an MMORPG –a genre that has lost momentum overall. More recently they have adapted the hit PC games for mobile, extending the lifecycle of the IP and increasing overall engagement and spend by reaching the much larger mobile gaming audience.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>The Fantasy Westward Journey IP has grown significantly since its mobile game release in 2015 and is set to grow further this year with a new title in the franchise, Fantasy Westward Journey 3D, which provides a new graphical style and additional gameplay features.</em></blockquote><hr><h3 id=\"spin-offs\"><strong><strong>Spin-Offs</strong></strong></h3><p>NetEase also has a history of selling off or IPO’ing its new bets. This strategy seems uncommon of the current crop of American tech companies. The only modern western example I can think of quickly that does this are the companies within Barry Diller’s IAC empire.</p><p>Some examples from NetEase include:</p><ul><li>Kaola – An e-commerce platform that NetEase launched in January 2015 was sold to Alibaba for US$2 billion in September 2019.</li><li>NetEase Comics – Not long after helping to launch Marvel’s first Chinese superheroes, NetEase <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/12/netease-sells-comics-assets-to-bilibili/\">sold</a> a large number of popular storylines to Bilibili (a company that will be the topic of a future issue)</li><li>Youdao – Mentioned briefly above as it accounted for ~2% of NetEase’s total revenues, is a public company (NASDAQ: DAO) that trades at a US$3.5 billion market cap. NetEase still owns about 60% of Youdao and continues to consolidate Youdao’s financials into its own</li></ul><p>Among the ‘other bets’ (or as NetEase calls them, “Innovative businesses and others”) that remain in-house, NetEase’s properties include:</p><ul><li>Yanxuan – Launched in April 2016 is an e-commerce platform selling private label goods (food, apparel, homeware, kitchenware, general merch from original design manufactures in China)</li><li>NetEase Cloud Music, which has raised over US$1 billion from external investors including General Atlantic, Baidu, and Alibaba. It’s not hard to imagine NetEase Cloud Music going public just as Tencent Music did.</li><li><a href=\"https://cc.163.com/\">CC Live Streaming</a> – a live streaming platform focused on gaming (a la Twitch)</li><li>NetEase Pay – A payment platform that it seems they built to try and compete with WeChat Pay and Ant but failed.</li><li>NetEase News</li><li>And still, 163.com which seems like a general ‘internet home page’ (like Yahoo.com) that offers links to news, shopping, entertainment, etc.</li></ul><h3 id=\"online-education\"><strong><strong>Online Education</strong></strong></h3><p>One of the big bets NetEase has made and that is broken out on its financials is Youdao which, at the highest level is a tech-enabled learning company.

Develop hit games and license foreign games (both very profitable)\n 2. Take cash from games\n 3. Invest in “new bets”\n\n(Naturally, easier said than done)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt a glance, NetEase in 2020 looks like a smaller Tencent.\n\n * NetEase is the second-largest game publisher in China behind Tencent\n * ‘NetEase Cloud Music’ is the second most popular music streaming service\n   behind Tencent Music\n * The NetEase email service seems to be the second most-used behind Tencent’s\n   QQ Mail\n\nNetEase’s revenues are heavily reliant on gaming:\n\n * 80% gaming,\n * 2% e-learning (Youdao), and\n * 18% from “Innovative businesses and others” which includes ‘NetEase Cloud\n   Music’, ‘CC live streaming’, and private-label e-commerce site, ‘Yanxuan’\n\nTencent, on the other hand, is more diversified with only about ~30%\n[https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2020/04/02/ed18b0a8465d8bb733e338a1abe76b73.pdf] \nof its total revenues coming from gaming.\n\nGames and JVs\nIn gaming, NetEase pursues a strategy similar to Tencent that I covered in my \nTencent Music [https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/tencent-music] issue,\n\n> “The road of foreign companies trying to enter China is littered with dead\nbodies. Having seen the failure of Google and Facebook to meaningfully enter\nChina and the mixed results of younger companies like Uber, foreign companies\nrealize that entering China directly is a battle that might not be worth\nfighting.”\nNetEase, like Tencent, is great at partnering with non-Chinese companies and\nbeing a partner (through a JV or similar structure) to the many businesses that\nwish to access the Chinese market.\n\nSource: South Park, Comedy CentralAbout 8% of NetEase’s annual revenues between\n2017 – 2019 came from games licensed from third-party developers.\n\nHarkening back to the South Park photo above (that episode got the show banned\n[https://www.scmp.com/video/china/3031973/south-park-creators-issue-mocking-apology-after-china-reportedly-bans-animated] \nfrom China), NetEase is also partnered with Marvel to develop games, television\nshows, and comics with Marvel characters for the Chinese audience.\n\nOne of the first initiatives was Marvel Super War, a League of Legends-esque\ngame using Marvel characters that was released in South Korea, Japan, Southeast\nAsia, India, and Australia.\n\nBeyond that, Marvel and NetEase worked together to create Marvel’s first Chinese\nsuperheroes. The characters were created by Chinese artists and writers,\nreviewed and approved by Marvel, and then introduced via a comic:\n\nSource: QZ\n[https://qz.com/quartzy/1274379/here-are-marvels-first-chinese-superheroes/], \nMarvel [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Lin_Lie_(Earth-616)]Some other NetEase\npartnerships that bring foreign IP into China include:\n\n * Mattel163.com is a joint venture between Mattel and NetEase.

This one does not\n   seem to be specifically for the Chinese market and is a part of NetEase’s\n   broader international expansion plans.\n * Pokémon\n   [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netease-pokemon/chinas-netease-to-launch-first-official-pokemon-game-in-china-idUSKCN1SQ0IM] \n   and NetEase are also developing the ‘first official Pokémon game in China’\n\nWhile NetEase does have some very high-profile JVs, most of the company’s\nrevenues are still derived from its portfolio of about 150 in-house developed\ngames. Mobile games are especially important for NetEase accounting for 71% of\ngaming revenues.\n\nWriting this NetEase breakdown helps me to understand the value of intellectual\nproperty and the value of ‘cinematic universes’ in a much deeper way.\n\nBesides licensing other company’s IP in China, NetEase has a plethora of\nin-house IP from its hundreds of mobile and PC based games. It’s begun to go\npast gaming, developing one of its hit games, Onmyoji into a feature film\n[https://mmoculture.com/2020/08/onmyoji-trailer-for-first-live-action-movie-revealed/]\n.\n\nNetEase also takes advantage of some “IP arbitrage” (perhaps, regulatory capture\nwould be more accurate) where it can find popular global IP (e.g., Marvel\nUniverse) and then work with Marvel to bring that content into China.\n\nThe regulators have made this practice even more pronounced in gaming where\nrecent regulations have mandated that “Foreign game companies must work with a\ndomestic game publisher who will operate the game in China.”\n\nThe other IP arbitrage that someone like NetEase can capitalize on is taking a\npopular gameplay mechanism (i.e., League of Legends’ MOBA style of play) and\ncreating a clone using Marvel IP. Marvel Super War, highlighted above, seems to\nfollow that exact strategy.\n\nIn terms of building lucrative in-house IP, I glossed over the fact earlier that\nNetEase first released Fantasy Westworld Journey in 2001, and then in 2017 (16\nyears later) when the mobile versions of the game were released, NetEase was\nstill able to generate US$1.5 billion in annual revenue.\n\nAs a Niko Partners report highlights\n[https://nikopartners.com/netease-games-strategy-a-free-report/]:\n\n> Legacy titles get expansion packs and new content regularly to keep players\nengaged. Fantasy Westward Journey has become an evergreen IP for the company and\nits revenue grew at a double-digit rate in 2019, despite being 15 years old and\nan MMORPG –a genre that has lost momentum overall. More recently they have\nadapted the hit PC games for mobile, extending the lifecycle of the IP and\nincreasing overall engagement and spend by reaching the much larger mobile\ngaming audience.\n> The Fantasy Westward Journey IP has grown significantly since its mobile game\nrelease in 2015 and is set to grow further this year with a new title in the\nfranchise, Fantasy Westward Journey 3D, which provides a new graphical style and\nadditional gameplay features.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpin-Offs\nNetEase also has a history of selling off or IPO’ing its new bets. This strategy\nseems uncommon of the current crop of American tech companies. The only modern\nwestern example I can think of quickly that does this are the companies within\nBarry Diller’s IAC empire.\n\nSome examples from NetEase include:\n\n * Kaola – An e-commerce platform that NetEase launched in January 2015 was sold\n   to Alibaba for US$2 billion in September 2019.\n * NetEase Comics – Not long after helping to launch Marvel’s first Chinese\n   superheroes, NetEase sold\n   [https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/12/netease-sells-comics-assets-to-bilibili/] \n   a large number of popular storylines to Bilibili (a company that will be the\n   topic of a future issue)\n * Youdao – Mentioned briefly above as it accounted for ~2% of NetEase’s total\n   revenues, is a public company (NASDAQ: DAO) that trades at a US$3.5 billion\n   market cap. NetEase still owns about 60% of Youdao and continues to\n   consolidate Youdao’s financials into its own\n\nAmong the ‘other bets’ (or as NetEase calls them, “Innovative businesses and\nothers”) that remain in-house, NetEase’s properties include:\n\n * Yanxuan – Launched in April 2016 is an e-commerce platform selling private\n   label goods (food, apparel, homeware, kitchenware, general merch from\n   original design manufactures in China)\n * NetEase Cloud Music, which has raised over US$1 billion from external\n   investors including General Atlantic, Baidu, and Alibaba. It’s not hard to\n   imagine NetEase Cloud Music going public just as Tencent Music did.\n * CC Live Streaming [https://cc.163.com/] – a live streaming platform focused\n   on gaming (a la Twitch)\n * NetEase Pay – A payment platform that it seems they built to try and compete\n   with WeChat Pay and Ant but failed.\n * NetEase News\n * And still, 163.com which seems like a general ‘internet home page’ (like\n   Yahoo.com) that offers links to news, shopping, entertainment, etc.\n\nOnline Education\nOne of the big bets NetEase has made and that is broken out on its financials is\nYoudao which, at the highest level is a tech-enabled learning company. It has a\nwide suite of learning products and services.\n\nRevenue comes from:\n\n * Premium courses (45%)\n * Advertising (41%) -- presumably from course creators that want to get their\n   courses in front of the most students.\n * Device sales (4%)\n * Premium services (9%) on e.g., Dictionary app, Note-taking app\n\nPigs:\nSource\n[https://www.tabpear.com/articles/How-is-chinas-biggest-game-company-Netease-pig-farm]\nOne thing that is immaterial to NetEase’s business, but that I felt the need to\ncover are Ding Lei’s pig farms, NetEase Weiyang.\n\nChina is the world’s largest supplier, producer, consumer, and importer of pork.\n\nSince 2011, NetEase has been building pig farms throughout China. As recounted\non one website\n[https://www.republikcitynews.online/behind-chinas-pork-miracle-how-technology-is-transforming-rural-hog-farming-environment/]\n:\n\n> The story began when Ding Lei, the company’s founder, was eating hotpot with\nfriends and began to worry that the blood tofu, a traditional ingredient made of\ncoagulated pigs’ blood, was synthetic. At that moment, Ding’s business plans\nturned from gaming into pig farming.\nToday the company operates four major farms. In 2019, NetEase agreed\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-industry-brings-home-the-bacon-11569300263] \nto invest US$211 million to build the fourth pig farm outside of Shanghai.\n\n> Industrialized farming is an information business, and Weiyang declares itself\nto be combining “internet thinking and modern agriculture”. That means farming\nwith the kind of detail and precision involved in developing software – a level\nof control over every microscopic variable along the way, such as pig stress\nlevels.\nWhile Ding does not intend to make a ton of money with his pig farming\noperations, his goals are\n[https://kr-asia.com/chinese-pig-farms-are-using-ai-solutions-to-fatten-profits] \nto, “revive Chinese livestock-rearing methods and to win government and consumer\ngoodwill for NetEase.”\n\nOr as he said\n[http://tabpear.com/articles/How-is-chinas-biggest-game-company-Netease-pig-farm] \non a separate occasion:\n\n> When describing his vision for Netease pig raising, Ding Lei used an analogy -\nhe hopes to put the open-source Linux thinking in the computer field on pigs.\n\"Linux is open and free. We use the Internet to disclose the entire process and\ndata of pig raising. Let's participate together, share it together, improve it\ntogether, and make the production model more efficient.\"\nThis is something that other major companies in China have taken notice of:\n\n * Baidu has invested in “AI for pig farming” startups\n * Alibaba has applied its AI tech to several pig farms where “the system uses\n   intelligent sensors and AI to accurately profile and identify each pig, with\n   detailed, real-time information about a pig’s health or birth prospects”\n * JD.com invested directly into a pig farm in northern China and will supply\n   the farm with their technology to improve operations\n * Vanke, China’s third-largest property developer by sales, announced\n   [https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3084237/homebuilder-china-vanke-move-pig-farming-property-market] \n   plans to start a 250,000-pig farm in China\n\nLong, pork! 🐷\n\nSource\n[https://www.tabpear.com/articles/How-is-chinas-biggest-game-company-Netease-pig-farm]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll said, China’s regulation of the gaming industry creates positives and\nnegatives for NetEase\n\nHeadwinds for NetEase, as Niko Partners\n[https://nikopartners.com/game-regulations-in-china-everything-you-need-to-know/] \npoints out, include:\n\n * Censorship on violence and gore\n * Curfews on minors (i.e., can’t play between 10:00 pm and 8:00 am)\n * Minors can only play for 90 minutes/day on weekdays and 3 hours/day on\n   weekends and holidays\n\nBut the flip side, as pointed out above, is that foreign companies looking to\nhave their game in China will need to work with a domestic partner.\n\nIf NetEase continues its growth throughout SEA and Japan tied with a more\nmonopolistic position as one of the few Chinese partners for international\ncompanies looking to expand, Netease has an exciting few years ahead.\n\n(Sorry for a lame conclusion this week!

Taiwan has beat COVID though and I'm\nexcited to have a normal life again. \n\nOn Asia: Not only do I like Asia a lot, but I also think that the opportunities\nin the region (specifically Southeast Asia) are going to be massive over the\nnext decade and I want to be a part of that. I also think living in Asia will\nhelp me to grow the East Meets West brand. \n\n8. \n\nI'm reminded even more this year of the importance of friends and family. \n\nOne of the reasons that quarantine was so manageable (dare I say enjoyable) at\nthe beginning was thanks to my great roommates in SF at the time. Many great\ngames of Super Smash Bros were played. One of the reasons my next phase of 2020\nwas enjoyable was because I left SF and stayed with my family in Arizona. By\nfar, this was the most consecutive time I've been able to spend with my parents\nand sisters since I was a senior in high school and that's something I'm\ngrateful for (insert: Tim Urban's The Tail End\n[https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html]). The photo below comes from\na 10-day trip I took to New Jersey (where I grew up) in August. All the other\npeople in that photo are some of my best friends from high school (many people\nincluding Zach, Bucky, Bovo, Rob, and Meg are missing). It's amazing that no\nmatter how long I go without seeing them we're always able to pick up a\nconversation like we saw each other the day before. It's truly an amazing thing. \n\nSource: My Instagram [https://www.instagram.com/ryanrodenbaugh/]Random... \n\n * Favorite Movie: (1) The best movie I watched this year even though it wasn't\n   released in 2020 was The Handmaiden\n   [https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_handmaiden].

In non-fiction, I liked The Courage to be\n   Disliked\n   [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked].\n   That is a book I'll be gifting to others.

And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn\nthat, you'll never be the same again.”\nLewis Carroll:\n\n> “IN THE END… We only regret the chances we didn’t take, the relationships we\nwere afraid to have,and the decisions we waited too long to make.”\nTim Urban:\n\n> “Be humbler about what [you] know, more confident about what's possible, and\nless afraid of things that don't matter.”\nMae West:\n\n> \"Those who are easily shocked should be shocked more often\"\nSteven Pressfield, Gates of Fire:\n\n> “Nothing fires the warrior’s heart more with courage than to find himself and\nhis comrades at the point of annihilation, at the brink of being routed and\noverrun, and then to dredge not merely from one’s own bowels or guts but from\none’s discipline and training the presence of mind not to panic, not to yield to\nthe possession of despair, but instead to complete those homely acts of order\nwhich Dienekes had ever declared the supreme accomplishment of the warrior: to\nperform the commonplace under far-from-commonplace conditions.”\nAyn Rand:\n\n> “Every form of happiness is private. Our greatest moments are personal,\nself-motivated, not to be touched. The things which are sacred or precious to us\nare the things we withdraw from promiscuous sharing. But now we are taught to\nthrow everything within us into public light and common pawing. To seek joy in\nmeeting halls. We haven't even got a word for the quality I mean--for the\nself-sufficiency of man's spirit. It's difficult to call it selfishness or\negotism, the words have been perverted, they've come to mean Peter Keating.\nGail, I think the only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime\nconcern within other men. I've always demanded a certain quality in the people I\nliked. I've always recognized it at once--and it's the only quality I respect in\nmen. I chose my friends by that. Now I know what it is. A self-sufficient ego.\nNothing else matters.”\nPaulo Coelho, The Alchemist: \n\n> “Why do they make things so complicated?\"\n> \"So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can understand.,\"\nhe said. \"Imagine if everyone went around transforming lead into gold. Gold\nwould lose its value.\"\n> \"It's those who are persistent, and willing to study things deeply, who achieve\nthe Master Work.”\nPaulo Coelho, The Alchemist: \n\n> “When you possess great treasures within you and try to tell others of them,\nseldom are you believed.”\nSocrates: \n\n> “Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss\npeople.”\nAbraham Maslow: \n\n> “To the man who only has a hammer, everything he encounters begins to look like\na nail.”\nChristopher McQuarrie, Usual Suspects: \n\n> “The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't\nexist.”\nAbraham Lincoln: \n\n> “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four\nsharpening the axe.”\nRichard Feynman:\n\n> “Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself. The principle is that you must\nnot fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.”\nRobert A. Heinlein:\n\n> “A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a\nhog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a\nwall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act\nalone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer,\ncook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for\ninsects.”\nYuval Noah Harari:\n\n> “You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him\nlimitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.”\nJames D. Watson: \n\n> “Every time you understand something, religion becomes less likely. Only with\nthe discovery of the double helix and the ensuing genetic revolution have we had\ngrounds for thinking that the powers held traditionally to be the exclusive\nproperty of the gods might one day be ours. . . .”\nCalvin Coolidge:\n\n> “Christmas is not a time nor a season, but a state of mind. To cherish peace and\ngoodwill, to be plenteous in mercy, is to have the real spirit of Christmas.”\nBlaise Pascal: \n\n> “All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room\nalone.”\nAyn Rand, Atlas Shrugged: \n\n> “There's nothing of any importance in life - except how well you do your work.\nNothing. Only that. Whatever else you are, will come from that. It's the only\nmeasure of human value. All the codes of ethics they'll try to ram down your\nthroat are just so much paper money put out by swindlers to fleece people of\ntheir virtues. The code of competence is the only system of morality that's on a\ngold standard.”\nAyn Rand, Atlas Shrugged: \n\n> “Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence\nis the leper's bell of an approaching looter.”\nBlaise Pascal:\n\n> “I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.”","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586253633232-8161270c5b6e?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDExNHx8dHlwZXdyaXRlcnxlbnwwfHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"page","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2021-01-12T22:52:26.000Z","updated_at":"2021-01-13T00:01:39.000Z","published_at":"2021-01-13T00:01:39.000Z","custom_excerpt":"A collection of Ryan Rodenbaugh's favorite and most-repeated quotes","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"all","newsletter_id":null,"lexical":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"600219f0f6e7a9003962043c","uuid":"a83e2df8-abcf-4198-a1c8-99303773c0e2","title":"Tether","slug":"tether","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"hr\",{}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://blog.trusttoken.com/scaling-trust-announcing-tusds-next-stage-of-growth-44dedf4aded8\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMpAAzYDjw4&t=276s\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://youtu.be/f0DTg7EBfAU?t=639\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-blockchain-debate-podcast/id1493609456\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],0,\"Disclosure: I worked on a product that sought to unseat Tether.

Since then, I’ve spent time trying to understand where\nthe company is going with the Cash App.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntroduction:\nI’ve recently come across more companies trying to brand themselves as “Super\nApps for X”, where X = finance, travel, entertainment.\n\nI’ve come to think of these as ‘narrow super apps’. While there are great\nrewards for being a narrow ‘Super App’, these descriptions feel mostly like\nmarketing ploys.\n\nThe Cash App is already well on its way to becoming a narrow “Super App for\nFinance” (aka… a Bank) with offerings that include p2p payments, checking\naccounts, debit cards, stock and crypto investing, and pilots including \nmicrolending [https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/square-cash-app-borrowing/].\n\nSource\n[https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2020/fdic-approves-square-for-banking-license/]\nI have no doubt that Cash App’s financial offerings will continue to expand\nuntil they have all the offerings you’d expect of a legacy bank like Chase\n(besides the physical branches, of course) .\n\nSquare’s prominence in payments, sets them up to grow into a more general Super\nApp. Of the dozen or so global general ‘Super Apps’ around the world, most got\ntheir start in one of three categories:\n\n * Messaging/Social: WeChat, Line, Kakao, Zalo, (aspiring ones like WhatsApp\n   [https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/aspiring-super-app-1-whatsapp-facebook]\n   )\n * Transportation/Delivery: Grab, Gojek, Careem, Rappi\n * Payments: Alipay, Paytm, Kaspi\n   [https://diff.substack.com/p/kaspikz-how-a-bank-turned-into-a], (+ Cash App)\n\nFor the rest of this post, let’s focus on Square beyond banking.\n\nFraming Square as a Super App:\nThere is a large extent to which a Super App is able to rise to dominance\nbecause -- by the success of its first killer feature (messaging,\ntransportation, or payments) -- it has a wider distribution than most/all other\ncompanies in its geographic market.\n\nSuper Apps are able to convince other companies to build on their platform\nbecause it’s a shortcut to a wide distribution for the new product or service.\n\nA (wordy) afterthought paragraph in my WhatsApp\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/aspiring-super-app-1-whatsapp-facebook] \narticle sums this up:\n\n> Super Apps are like a government collecting a sales tax. Say Tencent takes a 5%\ncut of Didi rides hailed through WeChat. Didi won ride-hailing in China, in part\nbecause of the native WeChat integration following Tencent’s investment. In this\nanalogy, WeChat native integration = “government infrastructure”, so paying the\nSuper App tax is worth it.\n> It’s a bit like trading profit margin for distribution. [As developers already\ndo with e.g., the Apple App store]\nEven though Cash App is one of the most popular financial apps (across economic\nclasses) in the US., it’s still a challenge for Cash App to offer distribution\nfor other established companies (e.g., Uber, Starbucks, or Airbnb).\n\nFrom How to Build a Super App\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/a-framework-for-super-apps]:\n\n> Super Apps could simplistically be thought of as platform companies that are\nable to build out many verticals within one app. This has worked well in markets\nlike China, Indonesia, etc. because those markets did not have strong incumbent\ncompetitors.\nIt’s a tougher sell to get established businesses to pay a Super App tax in the\nUS. As the expansion of Super Apps shows\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/a-framework-for-super-apps]:\n\n> The evolution from a regular app to a Super App looks something like this:\n> Build 1 killer app (WeChat: messaging) or a suite of complementary apps (Gojek:\nMotorcycles, taxi, delivery) in-house —>\n> Do some formal BD/Partnership deals where you allow a third-party to offer their\nservices through your app (e.g., WeChat offering ride-hailing via Didi, Gojek\noffering medical product delivery via Halodoc) —>\n> Have a completely open product line where ANYONE can create their own app within\nyour app (WeChat: Mini programs)\nFor the Cash App, there may be a few formal partnership-type integrations (#2 in\nmy framework) that sit naturally on top of the Cash App.\n\nThere is some precedent for what this could look like within the Cash App. For\nusers of the Cash App’s debit card, they can activate “boosts” which give Cash\nBack at different merchants. Per Square’s 10k,  “some Boosts are selected and\nfunded by the Cash App team, while others will be funded by our partners”.\n\nInstead of the boost just activating a discount within a debit card, they could\ntake an approach similar to WeChat when it was getting mini-programs running\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-a-not-so-brief-history],\n\n> “WeChat also tried something with McDonald's where you could buy a coupon\nvoucher within WeChat and then show the QR code to your McDonalds Cashier to\nredeem the offer.”\nA potential flow could be there is e.g., a Shake Shack mini-program within the\nCash App, when you activate a ‘Shake Shack Boost’, it could launch into a menu\nwhere you add to cart → receive 10% discount → pay with Cash App → is delivered\nvia a delivery partner (more on that later).\n\nThat said, it’s just as likely to me that Cash App skips this step and focuses\nmore on its existing base of small/medium-sized businesses allowing online and\nin-person merchants to have their stores live on top of the Cash App.\n\nOversimplifying a bit, in my WeChat issue, I described\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-a-not-so-brief-history] \nmini-programs as “a storefront built on top of a payments app, rather than a\npayment experience built into a website.” In line with Square’s roots of\nbuilding hardware and software for merchants to streamline their operations, I\nenvision a similar opportunity of ‘storefronts on top of the Cash App’.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent Initiatives\nThe Cash App Clothing Brand\nMini-programs were the first thing I thought of when I saw that the Cash App\nlaunched a clothing line.\n\nSource\n[https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/12/3/22151590/cash-app-launching-branded-clothing-line]\nWhile it’s possible this clothing line was nothing more than a customer\nacquisition strategy, I see hints of what shops on the Cash App could look like.\n\nIf you go to shop.cash.app [https://shop.cash.app/] on desktop, when you reach\n‘payment information’ you can scan a QR code from your Cash App to quickly pay\nwithout needing to manually enter your payment information.

Many of the top e-commerce website builders\nare already accounted for. Let us assume that WooCommerce (owned by WordPress\ncreator, Automattic), Magento (owned by Adobe), and public companies Shopify,\nWix, BigCommerce are not available for sale.\n\nSquarespace is one of the top website builders, specifically for e-commerce\nplatforms, and overall, the top\n[https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/simple-website-builder/country/United-States] \nwebsite builder in the US.\n\nSquare and Squarespace already have at least one partnership stemming back to\nNovember 2019 when Squarespace (which historically focused on e-commerce)\nintegrated with Square’s POS software to better integrate offline (in-person)\nsales.\n\nAs was reported [https://tech.co/news/square-squarespace-partnership-2019-11] at\nthe time:\n\n> This should excite small and medium-sized businesses, as we think Square offers\nsome of the best POS hardware on the market, while Squarespace is one of the\nbest website builders and ecommerce platforms out there.\n(Wouldn’t even need to change the logos or names that much)While Square has a\nstrong ‘offline’ presence with its terminals and footprint in the retail and\nrestaurant industries, it’s ‘online’ payments penetration leaves a lot to be\ndesired.\n\nI stress this point because this O2O (“online-to-offline” as it is commonly\nreferred to in China) was one of the big breakthroughs in WeChat’s\ntransformation\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/wechat-a-not-so-brief-history] into a\nSuper App, “WeChat also began partnering with physical businesses to offer\nonline store functionality where in-person businesses could set up a digital\nstorefront and sell goods.”\n\nAs of October 2020, Squarespace seems to be in the early stages of preparing to\ngo public [https://www.ft.com/content/646814c5-1f8c-4ca8-9bd3-e64d4094a3fc].

Stripe and Square offer similar services to merchants, with\nSquare having a stronger presence with physical businesses (restaurants, retail)\nand Stripe with a stronger presence with online merchants (“GDP of the\ninternet”).\n\nConversion rates matter a lot for e-commerce. If Square can prove that Cash\nApp’s QR code online payments (like from the Cash App Shop flow pictured\nearlier) convert at a much higher rate then that would be a compelling case to\nsee Square’s e-commerce adoption increase, as well.\n\nExisting Infrastructure\nLike how WeChat and Alipay have interoperable hardware all throughout China,\nmany merchants throughout the US (and Canada, Australia, and Japan) have\nSquare’s POS hardware in their stores.\n\nAdding the option for all Square PoS hardware to be able to accept payment via a\nCash App QR code seems like a quick path to widespread merchant adoption.\n\nSquare already acts as the operating system for small and medium-sized in-person\nbusinesses throughout the US.

Is it a Square-optimized equivalent of an Accelerated Mobile Page\n    [https://amp.dev/] / Instant Article\n    [https://www.facebook.com/formedia/solutions/instant-articles], i.e., a\n    fast-loading HTML document that loads natively within the Cash App, but\n    where the shopping cart is owned by the merchant?\n 3. Or is it closer to a mini-program? Which, in my experience feels much more\n    native than e.g., a Facebook Instant Article.\n\nNo clear answer, but my gut says #2. This allows stores to adopt their existing\n Weebly/SquareSpace checkout flows directly to the Cash App and mobile. If the\nmerchant doesn’t have a Cash App-optimized mini-program, then it opens a normal\nwebsite that users can go through a similar flow with.\n\nTo possibly give some additional insight into Square’s ambitions within\nrestaurants, Patent Drop [https://patentdrop.substack.com/p/011-patent-drop] \nhighlighted that Square recently dusted off a patent for “location-based\ntransaction completion” within restaurants.\n\n> When someone has finished eating their food, Square describes the customer being\nable to open up their phone, request a bill through an app, and then\nautomatically receive the correct bill from the Square merchant device by using\nthe customer’s location information.\n> Each table would have a wireless beacon that transmits the location information\nof the buyer. When the buyer requests their bill, their phone will automatically\npick up their table number and then submit this information to the merchant\ndevice.\nThat seems cumbersome when an alternative flow could be as simple as:\n\n 1. You get to your table and scan a QR code that opens up a Cash App\n    mini-program menu\n 2. You add items to your cart and pay directly from the Cash App\n 3. Since the QR code is associated with your table, the server knows exactly\n    where to deliver the food.\n\n(That precise flow is one I ran into at a fast-casual restaurant in Shenzhen,\nChina. Since I didn’t have WeChat Pay or Alipay at the time, I wasn’t even able\nto order and had to have my friend order and pay for me)\n\nSquare’s adoption with millions of merchants, puts them in a particularly\ncompetitive position to drive change at scale for restaurants in the “post-COVID\nworld”.\n\nSource [https://www.flickr.com/photos/kongharald/33442101433]Delivery:\nIt’s interesting to think about Square’s prior Caviar acquisition (and eventual\nCaviar sale to DoorDash) in light of a Super App strategy.\n\nIn 2016, addressing Caviar, Dorsey said\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/square-ceo-jack-dorsey-defends-caviar-2016-11],\n\n> Any of those Caviar restaurants could eventually take advantage of Square\nservices as well, and this is how we think about our ecosystem — it’s not just\none product but they all work better together.\"\nAt the time, Dorsey seems to have viewed Caviar as an acquisition tool for\nSquare’s core merchant business.\n\nAt present, there are two paths for merchants to manage delivery via Square:\n\n 1. A merchant’s Square terminal aggregates all the different delivery service\n    APIs so that you don’t have a scenario like the photo below\n\n(Source\n[https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/02/06/heres-why-this-french-restaurant-owner-trashed-a-half-dozen-food-delivery-tablets/]\n) 1. More interesting is the June 2020 announcement of “On-Demand Delivery for\n    Square Online Store sellers\n    [https://squareup.com/us/en/press/on-demand-delivery-sos]”\n\nIn this on-demand model, a customer can go to a restaurant's website (e.g,. \nKebab Shop [https://www.orderthekebabshop.com/]) and order delivery directly\nfrom a restaurant’s website without ever knowing which delivery company is being\nused. This is great for merchants as it allows them to maintain a direct\nrelationship with the customer, whereas if they used one of the delivery\nservices, they would not receive the customer information.\n\nA subtle point of why Square is able to do this is because they are not\ncompeting with restaurants for customer information. Square is very happy to\nallow restaurants to own customers’ email, phone numbers, etc. As they highlight\nin the release of “On-Demand Delivery”\n\n> “Additionally, when buyers place an order through Square Online Store, sellers\nreceive their contact information in the Square Customer Directory and are able\nto maintain sales history for those customers. When paired with other products\nlike Square Marketing and Square Loyalty, sellers can strengthen customer\nrelationships, create open lines of communication, and incentivize patrons to\nkeep coming back.”\nSquare grows with their merchants (and charges for value-added services). If a\nmerchant is growing their business and rolodex of customers, while using “Square\nmarketing” and “Square loyalty”, Square is happy.\n\nSquare is able to charge its standard processing fees, a flat $1.50 per\non-demand delivery fee, AND commoditize the delivery aspect to companies that\nspecialize in that. Interestingly, Square’s first partner on this is Postmates\n(not DoorDash/Caviar).\n\nWhile it would be a challenge for an established app like DoorDash to live on\ntop of the Cash App, I could imagine the Cash App offering a “restaurant” tab in\ntheir app that shows you local restaurants (only those using Square Merchant\nservices) and you can order, check out via Cash App, and have it delivered via a\nsuite of competing delivery vendors (Postmates, Caviar) all within the Cash App.\n\nI think it’s tough for any one of the delivery platforms to engender real\ncustomer loyalty (though DashPash and Uber Pass are stepping in the right\ndirection).\n\nWrapping Up\nCompetition\nWhile writing this I thought to myself, what would stop other neo-Banks from\ncopying this playbook? Revolut, for example, has very public ambitions of being\na “financial Super App”.\n\nHowever, what no other competitor has is an existing network of millions of\nmerchants already using their payments services.\n\nSquare is unique in terms of having a well-adopted B2B product, hardware\ndeployed all around the country, and a wildly popular consumer app.\n\nWhere could this be wrong?\n 1. Everything you read above is me projecting my own ideas and the concepts of\n    this newsletter onto Square\n 2. Shop.cash.app is just an attempt at a unique channel for Cash App customer\n    acquisition. It’s not a prototype of what a storefront on top of the Cash\n    App could look like\n 3. There’s an open question whether restrictions from Apple App Store and\n    Google Play stores would allow Square to offer a competitive service on\n    their devices\n 4. It's TBD whether QR code payments will (or should) be widely adopted in the\n    US when NFC payments seem to be more prevalent and secure.\n\nConclusion\nAt a time when small and medium-sized businesses are struggling, the Cash App\ncould offer an opportunity for local shops to easily digitize and more\nprofitably sell goods online while creating an extremely powerful moat and\necosystem, integrating their B2B and consumer products.\n\nIf you liked this article, please consider giving it a “❤️” on Substack or\nsharing it with friends!","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556742504-16b083241fab?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDMwfHxzcXVhcmV8ZW58MHx8fA&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":1,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","created_at":"2021-01-17T15:47:27.000Z","updated_at":"2021-01-17T15:53:02.000Z","published_at":"2021-01-17T15:53:02.000Z","custom_excerpt":"A mini-series on apps that could be 'Super Apps'.

Goodwater Capital sums this up in their write-up:</p><blockquote>When it started ten years ago, Coupang started with a seller-centric interface similar to eBay, but moved over to a product-centric interface more akin to Amazon in order to solve problems like duplicate listings and multiple prices in order to make the customer experience better.</blockquote><p>It’s at this point that people (investors, the media, consumers) began drawing comparisons to Amazon. Coupang embarked on building their own logistics network, called Rocket Delivery so that they could “delight customers” by owning the experience end-to-end and guaranteeing delivery times. Kim recounted this period and shift by <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/04/coupang-harvard-dropout-bom-kim-built-koreas-most-valuable-start-up.html\">saying</a>:</p><blockquote><em>“What seemed like a curse at that time — that we had to build this entire infrastructure, and build the technology to integrate it all, end-to-end, by ourselves, from scratch — ended up becoming a huge blessing,”</em></blockquote><p>Rocket Delivery is one of the core differentiators of Coupang that has allowed them to surpass the competition. Coupang’s CEO has referred to the Rocket<strong> Deliverymen</strong> as ‘the weapon that Amazon doesn’t have’. In the early <a href=\"https://restofworld.org/2020/the-cost-of-convenience/\">days</a>, “to win over female customers in their 20s and 30s — a key demographic — Coupang Men handed out flowers and handwritten cards, snapped photos of packages to confirm delivery, and would know not to ring the doorbell at homes with babies.”</p><p>Today, several of the company’s executives (CFO, previous COO) and key employees (head of private label, head of fulfillment services) hail from Amazon. Coupang also operates Korea’s largest directly employed delivery fleet in Korea with 15,000+ drivers</p><p>One of the reasons Coupang is able to offer its customers such crazy delivery speeds is that, in addition to building up a vast logistics network,</p><blockquote>“<strong>70% of the population lives within 7 miles of a Coupang logistics center</strong>. Our operational infrastructure spans over 25 million square feet across over 30 cities, a footprint of over 400 football fields in a country that is 1% the size of the US geographically. Coupang has the largest B2C logistics footprint as compared to other product e-commerce players in Korea”</blockquote><p>As Goodwater highlights, “So while South Korea has the same amount of land as Indiana, its actual usable land area is actually closer to that of Rhode Island.”</p><h3 id=\"korea-and-super-apps\"><strong>Korea and Super Apps?</strong></h3><p>While on the surface, Korea is a small country (population of 50mm), the opportunity reminds me of a question I received from a reader a while back.</p><p>A subscriber asked,</p><blockquote><em>“what is the scale of the market that makes sense as a precondition to build a SuperApp or at least worthwhile in the direction of SuperApp?

To use western analogs, Coupang’s is a combination of Amazon\n(e-commerce, proprietary logistics) + DoorDash (food and on-demand delivery) +\nInstacart (groceries).\n\nFast facts:\n * The company is Korea’s third-largest employer. As of November 2020, they \n   employed [http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=55293] \n   43,171 people.

As Forbes recounts:\n\n> “Kim headed off to Harvard Business School, where he grew fascinated with\nGroupon and flash sales sites like Gilt Groupe--and was convinced he could\ntransplant the idea to Korea. He raised $2 million from American investors,\nincluding hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, and dropped out of school in\n2010.”\n> I was a very fortunate day one investor in .@Coupang\n[https://twitter.com/Coupang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw].

Thank you to Bom and the Coupang team on behalf\nof all of us!\n\n— Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) March 15, 2021\n[https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1371460410130436099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\n(🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐)\n\nVery quickly though, in addition to selling other people’s deals, Coupang also\nstarted selling its own merchandise, starting with travel packages and fresh\nfoods.\n\nBy 2015, the company had raised about US$400mm, crossed US$1bn in sales, and was\npreparing to go public with its Groupon/eBay-esque business when Bom Kim\nscrapped plans for an IPO in order to turn Coupang into what it is today, an\nend-to-end e-commerce and logistics company. Goodwater Capital sums this up in\ntheir write-up:\n\n> When it started ten years ago, Coupang started with a seller-centric interface\nsimilar to eBay, but moved over to a product-centric interface more akin to\nAmazon in order to solve problems like duplicate listings and multiple prices in\norder to make the customer experience better.\nIt’s at this point that people (investors, the media, consumers) began drawing\ncomparisons to Amazon. Coupang embarked on building their own logistics network,\ncalled Rocket Delivery so that they could “delight customers” by owning the\nexperience end-to-end and guaranteeing delivery times. Kim recounted this period\nand shift by saying\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/04/coupang-harvard-dropout-bom-kim-built-koreas-most-valuable-start-up.html]\n:\n\n> “What seemed like a curse at that time — that we had to build this entire\ninfrastructure, and build the technology to integrate it all, end-to-end, by\nourselves, from scratch — ended up becoming a huge blessing,”\nRocket Delivery is one of the core differentiators of Coupang that has allowed\nthem to surpass the competition. Coupang’s CEO has referred to the Rocket \nDeliverymen as ‘the weapon that Amazon doesn’t have’. In the early days\n[https://restofworld.org/2020/the-cost-of-convenience/], “to win over female\ncustomers in their 20s and 30s — a key demographic — Coupang Men handed out\nflowers and handwritten cards, snapped photos of packages to confirm delivery,\nand would know not to ring the doorbell at homes with babies.”\n\nToday, several of the company’s executives (CFO, previous COO) and key employees\n(head of private label, head of fulfillment services) hail from Amazon. Coupang\nalso operates Korea’s largest directly employed delivery fleet in Korea with\n15,000+ drivers\n\nOne of the reasons Coupang is able to offer its customers such crazy delivery\nspeeds is that, in addition to building up a vast logistics network,\n\n> “70% of the population lives within 7 miles of a Coupang logistics center. Our\noperational infrastructure spans over 25 million square feet across over 30\ncities, a footprint of over 400 football fields in a country that is 1% the size\nof the US geographically. Coupang has the largest B2C logistics footprint as\ncompared to other product e-commerce players in Korea”\nAs Goodwater highlights, “So while South Korea has the same amount of land as\nIndiana, its actual usable land area is actually closer to that of Rhode\nIsland.”\n\nKorea and Super Apps?\nWhile on the surface, Korea is a small country (population of 50mm), the\nopportunity reminds me of a question I received from a reader a while back.\n\nA subscriber asked,\n\n> “what is the scale of the market that makes sense as a precondition to build a\nSuperApp or at least worthwhile in the direction of SuperApp? US, China and\nSoutheast Asia are large markets. What about Israel, Italy or Korea? Are these\nmarkets big enough to sustain SuperApp to make the investment in building one\nworthwhile?”\nI responded:\n\n> I'd say it has less to do with the overall scale of the market, but rather with\nthe sophistication of the country's internet economy. I talk about this a bit in \nhow to build a super app\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/a-framework-for-super-apps] with a focus\non the fact that there are already a ton of great apps in a developed internet\neconomy (e.g., US) and it would be tough to get all of them to rebuild\nmini-programs and interoperability on top of another app. Netflix is not longing\nfor Uber’s distribution and vice versa.\n\nA follow-up thought that I briefly mentioned in the WhatsApp piece is that right\nnow WhatsApp is doubling down on countries with the most internet users (Brazil\nand India), not countries with the highest GDP (Japan, Germany, UK)\n\nBy that framework… Nigeria w/ 123M internet users and GDP 400bn is more primed\nfor a Super App than Italy with 54M internet users and 2 trillion GDP.\nAt the time Sequoia led Coupang’s 100m funding in 2014 (of course they did),\nMichael Moritz said, ‘Coupang is “the leading online retailer in South Korea –\none of the most attractive e-commerce markets in the world.”’\n\nI was surprised to learn that Korea has the highest smartphone penetration of\nANY country in the world (Korea: 96%, USA: 89%, China: 71%)\n\nBom Kim knew this and from the beginning, Coupang has been a mobile-first\ncommerce company with 70% of its transactions happening on mobile, as far back\nas 2014, Kim remarked “All of this makes us, we think, a glimpse into the future\nof e-commerce for the rest of the world”\n\nBeyond that\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/softbank-backed-e-commerce-giant-coupang-files-for-u-s-ipo]\n,\n\n> “South Korea’s e-commerce market is projected to be the third-largest in the\nworld in 2021, according to Euromonitor, behind only China and the U.S. The\nbusiness is large compared with the size of the economy because of a blend of\nspeedy service, dense populations, fast internet connections and fierce\ncompetition among family-run conglomerates, such as Shinsegae Inc. and Lotte\nShopping Co.”\nWhile Coupang isn’t a Super App in the way we’ve described other apps in this\nnewsletter (no mini-programs, native payments are still very nascent), it does\nseem primed to make that evolution if it chooses to.\n\nMost notably, Coupang is missing a prevalent payment system for its home\ncountry. It does operate a ‘one-tap’ pay product, but that is more along the\nlines of what you’d find in Amazon’s app (i.e., can be used within its closed\necosystem) and not a generalized payments product like AliPay, WeChat Pay, Grab\nPay, etc. that can be used at merchants all over the home country. I don’t know\nenough about Korea to write intelligently about whether or not the market is\nprimed for Coupang to offer that service, but it does not seem as if any other\ndigital player has won that market.\n\nSource: Statistia\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1061986/south-korea-most-commonly-used-mobile-payment-providers/]\nData from Statista shows\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1061986/south-korea-most-commonly-used-mobile-payment-providers/]\n,\n\n> According to a survey in South Korea in 2019, \"app cards\" mobile payment method\nprovided by card companies directly through their mobile apps were the most used\nform of mobile payment. The number of people who have used mobile payment\nmethods has increased over the past few years, however, app cards have seen\nsteadily decreased usage while Samsung Pay has seen modest increases as the most\ncommonly used method.\nAs we’ve described Super Apps in the past in this newsletter, Kakao and Naver\nseem to be the only companies that meet that bar, but it’s not a clear-cut\nwinner in the same ways we’ve discussed other apps. We should not rule out\nCoupang’s ability to become a Super App, but it is not a clearly stated goal for\nthe company.\n\nSoftbank’s Big Win\nMasa got a nice section in my piece on Ant Group\n[https://eastmeetswest.substack.com/p/understanding-ant-group] and he is worth\nhighlighting again today.\n\nSince DoorDash’s IPO I’ve been thinking that the Softbank Vision Fund probably\ndoesn’t deserve all the sh*t that has been throw at it.\n\nSoftbank invested about US$3bn in Coupang over the years for a stake that is now\nabout 35% of the company.\n\n0.35 * 100bn = 🤯\n\nCEO Magazine points out that\n[https://www.theceomagazine.com/business/finance/softbank/] “Coupang was the\nbiggest US initial public offering (IPO) by a foreign issuer since Alibaba Group\nHolding in 2014, and the biggest US new issue of any kind since Uber\nTechnologies in 2019.“\n\n * Who owned 30% of Alibaba at the IPO and is still the largest outside\n   shareholder today?
