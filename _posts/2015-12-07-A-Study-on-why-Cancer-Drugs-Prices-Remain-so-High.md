In college, I took an excellent course called about the "Politics and Policy of Cancer Research."

I was one of the only people in the class without a medical background and as a result, took a much different lens to a lot of the topics we discussed. I took this class around the same time that Martin Shkreli was in the news for increasing the price of Daraprim.

For my final paper in the course, I set out to write about why prices in cancer medication (and medication more broadly) were so high. I intended to critique that system, but pretty quickly realized, I felt more aligned with arguing FOR the high pricing in medicine.
